<p>You start the game with $1,000. Your mission is to survive the month without running out. That is the challenge people face when they hop on the website <a href="http://playspent.org/">Spent</a>. Designed for the Urban Ministries of Durham, North Carolina, this online game is intended to bring awareness to the difficulties people face in poverty.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>When you first enter Spent, you are asked to choose a job, healthcare plan, and living situation; these decisions are carried throughout the month. On each of the other 30 days represented in the game, you are required to make a different monetary decision. These include scenarios like whether or not to pay for your child’s field trip, attend your grandfather’s memorial service out of state, or help your mother pay for crucial medication. You can choose to pay during each of these situations or sacrifice the opportunity to save that money. The goal is to reach the end of the month with money left over, but this is no easy task; I didn’t make it through the month until my third try, and many of the scenarios were different each time. After almost all scenarios, a fact appears with a statistic of how many people are affected by these situations each year.</p>
 
<p>The game also connects with social media. In several of the decisions, players have the option to ask a friend for help via Facebook or Twitter. This advances the game forward without incurring costs, but you realize quickly how uncomfortable it can be to ask for help. This adds another dimension to the choices you must make in the game.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Because the game was created a few years ago, some of the statistics are not up-to-date. For instance, it seems like most of the facts presented are from 2012. While these numbers have likely not changed significantly since then, the game would be more relevant if it included more recent statistics.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Playing Spent is a great way to learn about the difficult decisions people who live below the poverty line must make. It brings to light many of the sacrifices they make each month just to survive. Not only is the game a way to raise awareness about poverty, it also gives users the option to donate to the Urban Ministries of Durham at the end. Because of this, in the months following the release of Spent, the organization raised almost $50,000 from new donors. It’s a far cry from going out into these communities and working directly with people, but Spent is a great educational tool for anyone who wants to teach or learn about living in poverty.</p>
