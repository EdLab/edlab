Atlas, a human-powered helicopter, is a project that quite literally takes off. The narrator of the video shares, "The winners of the Sikorsky Human-Powered Helicopter Competition didn't think outside the box, they just chose the right box to think in." What is even more remarkable is that in the thirty-four years of the competition, only one team has succeeded in meeting the challenge. This video captures the only winners in the competition’s history taking their historic first flight. <p>

First established in the 1980s by the American Helicopter Society (AHS) International, the Igor I. Sikorsky Human-Powered Helicopter Competition has very strict requirements. In order to win the $250,000 prize, the winner must maintain a flight duration of 60 seconds and reach an altitude of 9.8 feet, with the center point of the aircraft hovering over a 33 by 33 square foot square. The helicopter must be human-powered. Despite the countless attempts of many contenders over the years, <a href "http://www.aerovelo.com/"> AeroVelo’s </a> Atlas, built by students at the University of Toronto, is the first winner. This is not to say there have not been other successful HPHs built, but Atlas is the first of its size able to achieve the duration and height it did. <p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@0:06 Sappho J:</b> A human-powered helicopter! Interesting! It seems to be taking technology backwards....<p>

<b>@00:06 JordaJean:</b> What a great observation! I wonder the benefit to creating such a contest, where humans are the power source as opposed to something like solar power or even making these UAVs?<p>

<b>@00:32 Sappho J:</b>  It looks like peddling turns the wheels of the helicopter.<p>
