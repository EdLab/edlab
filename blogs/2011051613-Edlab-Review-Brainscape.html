             Edlab Review: <a href="http://www.brain-scape.com/">Brainscape</a>:
<a href="http://s1226.photobucket.com/albums/ee414/snookybutts/?action=view&amp;current=about.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1226.photobucket.com/albums/ee414/snookybutts/about.png" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a> 

Description: Brainscape is a basic online flash-card learning system.  Making an account only takes a couple seconds, and then you can begin studying their pre-loaded decks (GRE vocabulary, for instance), or create your own.
<!--break-->
Pros: Grounded (so they claim) in cognitive science, Brainscape has set up a system to take into account the cascading nature of reinforced learning.  <a href="http://s1226.photobucket.com/albums/ee414/snookybutts/?action=view&amp;current=repetitiongraph.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1226.photobucket.com/albums/ee414/snookybutts/repetitiongraph.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a> As their graph indicates, each time you learn something, your memory is set on a path of gradually decaying knowledge.  The effect of repetition is to push the curve up, so that your memory still decays, but the end state is one of higher knowledge.  As each flashcard is presented, you indicate your degree of confidence in your understanding of the word.  The greater your confidence, the less likely the program is to test you on the word again.  The user is provided with a color-coded bar next to the knowledge set he's working with, indicating the extent of his mastery of the material.

Cons: 
Sometimes the program flips the card around, and asks you to remember the word that fits the definition they give you.  This implies a little too much familiarity with the vocabulary set they've given you.  Much better is their standard method, where the user is given a word and must think up the definition.
The program has no sense of time, and adjusts the order of the cards by your confidence levels without taking into account the amount of time that has passed.  Perhaps each card should have its own internal clock, which is reset each time you answer it on an interval based on the accuracy or confidence of your answer.

Relevance: 
The incipient Flashcard project here at Edlab might be able to learn a couple things from this program.  The color-coded confidence scheme is probably more efficient on the front end, but over a long period I think it would be better to simply extract the learner's confidence from their success rate.  It feels both arbitrary and clunky to be choosing between “well” and “very well” to indicate how well you knew the answer. On the other hand, Brainscape claims that “the simple act of assessing one's own confidence in a topic is enough to deepen the memory trace," although as far as I could tell this claim is based on evidence from very different contexts.
The subjects are naturally split up into a group of card-sets, each of which is learned separately.  Space for students to split up the subject to suit their own taste, or even a method of dividing the subject by the learner's familiarity, might be worthwhile.
