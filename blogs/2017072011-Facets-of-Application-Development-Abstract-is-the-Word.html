          <p>
            <p>In this blog post I want to talk a little (sort of) bit about the several dimensions of an application development process. I am, by no means, an expert on this topic, and these blog posts are meant to be a collection of learnings I gathered from my experience and my extraordinary intelligence and critical thinking skills (:-P). My goal for all this talk is to propose a new (probably not, since all kinds of JIRA boards already exist) way of approaching product management. I propose what I can &quot;Issue Based Management&quot;, where a product manager tracks everyone's tracks solely based on issues created and iterated on a regular basis.</p><p><br /></p><p>I want to start off by breaking the process into several sub-processes, each dealing with a different dimension of the process, and all of them intersecting to varied levels to form a cluster mess of an indiscernible series of actions if not managed well. Following is the list:</p><p><br /></p><ul><li>Design</li><li>Application Architecture</li><li>Database Architecture</li><li>Back-end Architecture</li><li>Front-end Architecture</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>Another goal for this series of posts is to de-clutter the mess by focusing on each of the above separately, and see how they intersect with the rest of the list. <b>And as mentioned above, an overarching theme for all the above sub-processes is issue tracking and management.</b> I use the term &quot;issue&quot; in a very general sense, perhaps as used by BitBucket, splitting out into categories such as bugs, enhancements, tasks, etc. If well thought out, these categories, and perhaps some custom categories, can increase the efficiency of the development process immensely.</p><p><br /></p><p>The first thing to understand about all the above is that, as a general rule, engineering on any of the above starts off with a period of thinking of the abstract. For instance, designers spend a ton of time deciding colors, fonts, and other globals that will be used across the application before actually delving into designing the application. Developers (at least concerned ones) do the same. They think about abstract classes and functions that might be useful across the application before jumping into programming the whole application. Good engineers allocate time to this to map their design/development process, and the best ones need much lesser time to map everything out.</p><p><br /></p><p>But the other side to this story is over-spending time on architecting the abstract. Again, as a general rule, you're going to re-visit most of these decisions when you actually delve into the application. So it is important not to get lost in figuring out every minute detail. With time and experience, engineers will learn how to figure these out much quicker, but this is the point when you draw your courage and jump into writing code, code that might turn out useless, code that might be hated by a future developer, code that might break everything that already exists, but then maybe code that finally makes the application a reality.</p><br />
