          <p>
            This is a Cross-Post from the EdNode teambox. Any feedback would be appreciated.

I was taking a look at the user profile information we gather for EdNode users and there are a few more fields I feel as if we could benefit from:

1) Academic Information - Favorite Coursework. This can help connect students academically on a deeper level than a simple "What is your major?". An Economics major who specializes in studying the economics of underdevelopment is probably far more interested in connecting with an Ethnic Studies major with a similar course of study than they are another Econ major who is studying to become an investment banker.

2) Academic Information - Courses Taught/TA'd. A simple way of indicating proficiency in a field. If a student is looking for help with contemporary architecture, who better to serve as a mentor than someone who has TA'd a course in it?

3) Professional Information - Projects of Interest. If a user is looking for guidance as they take on a new project, it would be helpful if they could be directed to users that have undertaken similar endeavors.

Another benefit of keeping track of all three of the above is that they help to catalog who users are academically. The infamous "About Me" strategy that we currently adopt is useful, but can be a bit ambiguous. Users may be unlikely to identify themselves fully by their academic interests, choosing instead to provide more casual information like tastes and hobbies. Providing specific platforms for users to further identify themselves academically could also help in connection building. Personally, I would be far more likely to approach a user for help if I knew more about them than a school, a major, and a place of work.

What do you all think? Is this data useful or does it encroach on excess?
