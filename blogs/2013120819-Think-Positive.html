<b>Title:</b> "I am Really Good at It" or "I am Just Feeling Lucky": The Effects of Emotions on Information Problem-Solving (2013)
<p>
<b>Author:</b> Mingming Zhou
<p>
<b>Source:</b> <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11423-013-9300-y/fulltext.html">Educational Technology Research and Development</a>
<p>
<b>Study Design:</b>
Although the cognitive processes of learning are often viewed as an abstract, isolated issue, promising lines of research have opened up in investigating how non-cognitive factors can affect knowledge acquisition. In particular, the student’s attitude or mental state entering into a learning task can have a surprising influence on his success or failure.
<p>
This study took 107 Chinese university students, and examined how their "information search strategies" related to their emotional states, as assessed in a questionnaire. The students were then given two questions (1. How do bees choose where to build their new homes, and 2. What are the implications for human life), and encouraged to use internet searches to produce answers. Using an "information problem-solving" rubric, the subjects’ research patterns were decomposed and analyzed, allowing the authors of the study to compare how subjects with different emotional profiles approached the task.
<p>
<b>Findings:</b>
Although from a broader perspective, and in direct contradiction to earlier research, it did not appear that the students with positive emotions were more engaged on the task, there were distinctly different patterns in how students with positive and negative emotions approached their research. Students with negative emotions exhibited much more linear and mechanical search patterns, moving step-by-step through each necessary stage of the task. Students with positive emotions displayed more fluid search patterns, often going back to re-examine the test questions. As the authors point out, the obvious conclusion that students with negative emotions were more efficient workers is belied by the fact that, according to instructor ratings, students with positive emotions produced more logical and effective answers to the original questions.
<p>
<b>Moving Forward:</b>
The most important thing this study highlights is in its research methodology. The ability to log and process student computer activity allows for far more fine-grained investigations of learning styles than was previously possible, particularly for large-scale studies and large classrooms. Further studies might investigate the specific actions students with positive emotions take to produce more effective research. If the secret lies not in the amount but the manner of engagement, it would be worthwhile to discover how and why. More generally, fine-grained data on student activity has the potential to reveal a great deal on how learning takes place, and how it may be better supported.
