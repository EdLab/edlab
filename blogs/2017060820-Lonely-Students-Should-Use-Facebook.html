<p>Facebook is a contested educational tool. While some educators have used it as a supplementary platform for their class, others insist that using it only negatively impacts academic performance, especially when the social media platform becomes an addiction. A recent study examined the connections among Facebook usage, personality type, and academic performance. In particular, the researchers examined whether some personality types benefited more from time on Facebook than others.</p>
 
<p>To collect their data, the researchers administered over 1,000 questionnaires to students from five public universities in Malaysia. On these surveys, they assessed a student’s personality based on the big five model of traits: conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, openness to experience, and emotional stability. In addition to these traits, the authors added two more: loneliness and shyness. They examined how these traits affected academic performance and whether Facebook played a positive or negative role in that relationship.</p>
 
<p>They found that overall, the students who used Facebook were more likely to have better academic performance. It had a particularly positive influence on students who had high degrees of extraversion, agreeableness, or loneliness. The researchers think that Facebook helps extravert and agreeable students expand their social network and exchange more information on the platform; lonely students likely use the site to keep updated on the latest ideas and acquire info from their peers they might not receive in person.</p>
 
<p>This study supports the belief that Facebook brings more good to education than harm. This was true of the study even considering that it didn’t observe the site in a class, but rather just in the normal day-to-day use of students. The results also suggest that some personalities might benefit more from Facebook than others, especially extravert, agreeable, or lonely students. That said, Facebook had an overall positive association with academic performance, signifying that scrolling through a Facebook feed might not be so mindless after all.</p>
