            I attended a panel on global education at the Council on Foreign Relations last night. The event was hosted by the International Education and Resource Network (iEARN). <a href="http://www.iearn.org/" target = "blank">iEARN</a>, celebrating its 25th year anniversary, was founded during the dying days of the Cold War on the philosophy that US and Soviet students had more in common than they did apart. The panel focused on how educators across the country can build mutual understanding and global competency between youth through technology enabled classroom technology. The event started with a 30-minute exhibition of projects by US students with their peers in the Middle East and North Africa. The exhibition was part of the Chris Stevens Youth Network (named after ambassador <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Christopher_Stevens" target = "blank">Chris Stevens</a>, who was killed during the attack on the US embassy in Benghazi, Libya several years ago).

A panel discussion followed the exhibition. The panel was held in a small sized room at the Pratt House, which made for a small and intimate setting. The panel consisted of four educators from across the country who shared examples of collaborative projects by their students with their peers from across the world (see images below). The educators all noted to some degree that their students were much more engaged than usual during the projects and eventually showed a deeper understanding of global issues. The Q&A session focused on ways educators can start their collaborative projects with classrooms across the world.

There is certainly a need for students in today's world to learn more about youth and other cultures. It fosters empathy, tolerance and understanding. However, with our schools so focused on preparing students for standardized exams and the STEM subjects, educators find it increasingly difficult to incorporate other projects and activities into their existing curriculum.
