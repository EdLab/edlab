<p>
Peer Assessment, in which students evaluate and grade each other’s work, has evolved from an academic research area to a practical teaching strategy in collaborative learning. However, the focus of peer-assessment research has always been on how closely peer evaluations aligned with traditional instructor feedback. The accuracy and reliability of peer-generated grades themselves are less frequently addressed in the literature. With the ever-growing movement toward online courses, however, these issues deserve more attention. Will peer assessment become a mainstream evaluation method? Should it?
<p>
Researchers Cho & Schunn, in their 2006 paper <a href=" http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/edu/98/4/891/">"Validity and reliability of scaffolded peer assessment of writing from instructor and student perspectives,"</a> investigated the accuracy of peer-generated grades on writing projects from 708 students. To complete their peer assessments, students were given guidance, pre-constructed rubrics, and clear incentives. The study found that the aggregated ratings of at least 4 peers are both highly reliable and as valid as instructor ratings. The authors suggest that multiple reviewers, i.e., 4 to 6 peers, be used to ensure high reliability. Overall, the results indicate that, provided student peer evaluators are given clear and easy to follow instructions on carrying out evaluations, there should be no concerns about the reliability of their ratings.
<p>
Because instructors and students are different stakeholders in the evaluation process, they may have very different views about what constitutes accurate or reliable grading. Student reviewers are, almost by definition, <i>inexpert</i> in the discipline, and inexperienced in assessing the quality of work done in the relevant field. They are also prone to social biases, favoring friends and judging enemies more harshly. On the other hand, teachers might run into assessment issues due to their large workload.  Students are typically given much less work to evaluate and therefore they can spend more time examining any given task.  Additionally, each assignment can be evaluated by multiple students, so that a more accurate grade can be calculated by taking an average of multiple ratings.
<p>
The study reminds us that the evaluation process can be just as important as the learning results. To improve the quality of peer assessment, students are encouraged to be persistent in providing feedback, for which some <i>shepherding guidelines</i>, such as step-by-step check-lists, good/bad grading examples, and other formal instructions, are recommended.  Moving forward, educators might become more conscious of student evaluation skills, and guide their development so as to enable students to approach and solve problems collaboratively with their peers and independent of the instructor.
