<p>In the shift from print to digital media, the creators of <a href="http://liquidtext.net/">LiquidText</a> argue that typical document viewers on modern devices are developed with paper in mind, rather than with the variety of capabilities that technology can offer to viewing documents online. The app therefore seeks to provide your reading experience with features paper-based documents could never offer.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>If you’ve ever felt like printing out every single document you need for a project is too overwhelming and wasteful, yet never enjoyed the limitations of scrolling endlessly through one PDF after another, LiquidText might just be your solution. The app allows you to extract text out of documents and "pinch" distant pages within the document together for easier viewing—without having to scroll back-and-forth between pages two and eighty-two. It provides a workspace for you to organize your notes and excerpts, and also connect comments and excerpts for further organization.</p>
 
<p>LiquidText was created by a former doctoral student who put a great deal of effort into conducting the appropriate research to determine the best interactive features and functions for the app, so that users would feel like the experience was intuitive and useful. This effort certainly shows, as what could be complex maneuvering is relatively easy to navigate in the app.

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although LiquidText offers a variety of great features that makes organizing your thoughts and writing snippets easier, the interface might be a bit too complicated for younger students. Once enough extracted pieces of text crop up on the side of the user interface, it can become a bit disorienting to sift through them. It also takes practice to get used to connecting the text bubbles together. Finally, although the app is available in the Apple Store, it is not for Android devices nor does it make sense to be used on anything other than a tablet; an iPhone simply wouldn’t provide enough work space.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Like LiquidText asserts, most PDF readers are limited in flexibility, with users forced to circumvent the system by using two monitors in order to compare pages or opening two copies of the same document just to look at separate pages at the same time. Although LiquidText might not be the silver bullet of document viewers, it certainly provides a slew of tools and capabilities unmatched by any other competitor on the market.</p>
