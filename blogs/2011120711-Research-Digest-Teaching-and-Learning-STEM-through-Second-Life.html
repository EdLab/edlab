V., Abrahamson, D., Morgado, L., Esteves, M., Valcke, M., Vansteenbrugge, H., and Rosenbaum, E., & Barab, Sasha (2008).  Virtually there: emerging designs for STEM teaching and learning in immersive online 3D microworlds.  <i>Proceedings of the 8th international conference on International conference for the learning sciences - Volume 3</i>, 383-391.</a>

<b>Description:</b> This paper explores the designs for STEM teaching and learning in <a href ="http://secondlife.com/"> Second Life</a>. Educators in Europe and the U.S. both designed a curriculum that allows students to learn about introductory computer programming and mathematics. Students would use programming to create objects in the virtual world and collaborate in real time with their fellow students as well as other students from different schools. The goal of this paper is to show how the virtual world of Second Life can be an effective and exciting learning environment. Although there would be initial obstacles for implantation of Second Life STEM learning: professional development, collaboration with school systems, alignment with targeted content, and initial learning curves.


<b>Edlab Relavance:</b> The experiment that this paper describes is radically different from the traditional learning we have today. This can be a new way to get students more engaged in learning programming, by allowing them to create objects and define their functions in a virtual world. I feel that students learn can potentially much about programming by having a better visual of how their codes work through Second Life.

Another aspect of this new experimental way of teaching that I find interesting is the potential for massive collaborative learning. Second Life has the ability to provide students a chance to collaborate with other students from around the world. This would give students a chance to get more diverse perspectives on a programming lesson or programming implementation. Although programming is more of a solitary activity, students can still benefit from collaborating. Students would have a grand audience to view and critique their work, and with the feedback provided students can improving their programming skills.

At first it may seem that teaching mathematics through Second Life may not necessarily be more advantageous than traditional learning, but after reading this paper I do not believe this to be true. The authors describe the potential of a constructionist learning, Fractal Village. Students would learn about fractals by exploring the village and observing the different <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal"> fractal</a> structures in the virtual world, and have the ability to create fractal objects of their own. From this I'd say we can have a much more engaging way to teach math subjects like geometry, and other subjects like architecture. 

All in all what Second Life provides for STEM learning is the ability for students to have a more engaging way of learning subjects like programming and fractal shapes, and also the potential to have a assistive collaborative learning experience. Teachers would still have a very important role to play in this virtual learning, as they can guide students through the lessons and help them along the way. What interests me the most is the fact that through this virtual learning students will get the chance to work with other students outside their classrooms, which sounds very liberating to me.
