<p>Whether you’re a beginner or a pro, <a href="https://www.chesscademy.com">Chesscademy</a> claims it will help improve your chess game. It’s an online platform that provides chess learners with videos, quizzes, practice exercises, and sliding-scale difficulty games against computers.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The lessons on Chesscademy are scaffolded; there are currently six levels that learners can work their way through to complete the entirety of content. Many of the videos and exercises on Chesscademy are made by chess masters and educators. This means that the lessons are generally of high quality. The videos I watched were clear and highlighted classic chess techniques that any aspiring player should know. After watching a video, learners are required to complete a series of exercises related to the lesson in order to get hands-on practice with the relayed information. For me, this feature was the most salient and compelling; this is why I would continue to use this site. The exercises were challenging, yet well explained. I feel like my game probably improved from just a few rounds.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>

<p>When I come across a site that is consistently slow to load or has occasional loading errors, I realize how much I take smooth-moving sites for granted. This is one of those times. Unfortunately, Chesscademy frequently took longer to load than the average internet user might expect. Without some system changes, it could be difficult to keep learners coming back.</p>

<p>In addition, Chessacademy could better hone some of its pedagogical techniques. When taking a quiz, it would be better to allow users to immediately correct an incorrect answer and explain why this is the case rather than making them start from the beginning again. Also, Chesscademy would be improved with explanation guides for game techniques you might miss through the scaffolded learning. For instance, while I scored out of the introductory courses, I did not know the established chess demarcations of piece and board location, which made the explanations difficult to understand at first. A fun addition to the platform would be the ability to challenge other users to games, rather than strictly having access to computerized opponents.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Chesscademy could be a useful learning platform for anyone interested in improving their chess game. The lessons have many strong points, including being created by actual chess masters and educators and offering hands-on practice. Despite these positive features, the platform might run too slowly for even patient learners, and some of the educational and community-building features could be improved.</p>
