<p><i>"In a rapidly changing world, education has become one of the foremost frontiers for social entrepreneurship and innovation. The Education Design Studio, Inc. (EDSi) is a hybrid incubator and seed fund designed to tackle some of education’s most difficult problems."</i> (<a href="http://www.e-designstudio.com/community/story/">The EDSi Story</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>A Social Entrepreneurship Approach to Education</b></p>
 
<p>EDSi combines social entrepreneurship with learning to solve society's most intractable educational issues. Over the past two years, this Philadelphia-based studio has tripled its roster of edtech startups that it grows through funding, learning, and support.</p>
 
<p><b>Educational Focus on Technology</b></p>
 
<p>Unfortunately, Philadelphia has been left out of the conversation when it comes to heavyweight edtech centers. But in the city that inspired "Rocky," EDSi has fought back against these perceptions. Growing out of the Milken-Penn Graduate School of Education Business Plan Competition, EDSi launched in 2013 to improve education startup success. Building on its educational roots, EDSi tackles a wide range of learning issues like adaptive vocabulary learning systems and teacher training through its curriculum that leads to high rates of success for the carefully selected projects.</p>
 
<p><b>Blended Learning Approach</b></p>
 
<p>EDSi is devoted to teaching and learning in a flexible manner that serves its entrepreneurial clientele. EDSi delivers curriculum to its team of edtech innovators through online weekly learning sessions as well as convenient in-person weekend intensive sessions spread out over six months. This in-depth learning trajectory allows entrepreneurs to concurrently commit to their startup ideas as well as entrepreneurial learning. EDSi’s success comes from Penn’s renowned research, on-site product beta testing, as well as strong support from business and edtech experts.</p>
 
<p><b>Showing Philadelphia Some Edtech Brotherly Love</b></p>
 
<p>Philadelphia's edtech sector has been sorely neglected compared to better established hubs in San Francisco, New York City, and Boston. EDSi’s efforts are intended to change that. </p>
