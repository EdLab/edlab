<p>In a globalized society, academic exchange is becoming more common, with experts from one country traveling to teach and share their ideas in another. This exchange can be of great benefit, exposing students to the best thinkers in the world on their subject, but can also cause some problems. One of these is the language barrier that may exist between the visiting teacher and the local students. Generally, foreign experts teach in English, and while local students do their best to comprehend the material, the stress of keeping up in a foreign language may get in the way of their learning.  </p>

<p>This randomized controlled trial sought to examine ways to reduce the cognitive load placed on students when material is presented in a foreign language. They recruited 60 undergraduate students whose native language is Russian to participate in the study, for which they attended lectures provided in English. Each student listened to the same two lectures in one of three conditions: with no support, with transcripts provided in English, or with transcripts automatically translated into their native language through speech-enabled language translation supported by Google Translate.  </p>
 
<p>Using a headset that monitors brain activity, the researchers measured each participant’s attention and meditation. Participants also filled out a questionnaire survey to evaluate their perceived cognitive load during the lectures. The results indicated that student attention and meditation were highest when they received speech-enabled language translation while listening to the lectures. In addition, students in this condition perceived lower cognitive load than the other two groups and were also more satisfied with the learning experience.  </p>

<p>The findings suggest that speech-enabled language translation could represent a useful tool for increasing engagement in lectures taught in a language foreign to students. Although there are still some issues with the accuracy of the translations for certain languages, this method is an exciting way to break the barriers to learning for students all over the world. </p>
