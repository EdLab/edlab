          <p>
            After presenting my EDAR project today, I was thinking a bit about the cult of tools: "This project would be more cool if it ran on the iPhone."  Or streamed through a browser.  Or used the Cocoa API.

All these possibilities make me cringe.  Partially for quite pragmatic reasons:  I know how much darn time I spent making a working project which happens not to run on the iPhone or a web browser.  The host of nasty problems which would arise on one of these platforms freaks me out.  It is silly to use a newfangled tool when the extant ones work just fine.

But moreso, I fear becoming a servant of a technology. If the tools determine an art project, beware!  The great photographer and printer Richard Benson said that you can only make art with obsolete technologies.  Perhaps because the rapture of the new keeps the maker from understanding much else?  Thoreau said "beware of all enterprises that require new clothes, and not rather a new wearer of clothes."

Here is a bit from an essay by Brecht (<em>Writing the Truth: Five Difficulties</em>, 1935):

<blockquote>Thus, for example, it is not untrue that chairs have seats and that rain falls downward. Many poets write truths of this sort. They are like a painter adorning the walls of a sinking ship with a still life. ... it is not easy to realize that their truths are truths about chairs or rain; they usually sound like truths about important things. For it is the nature of artistic creation to confer importance. But upon closer examination it is possible to see that they say merely: a chair is a chair; and: no one can prevent the rain from falling down.</blockquote>

Making digital art which shows that it was built with the latest technologies is like writing a poem about chairs and rain.  (Though compared to the truths about power and society which Brecht advocates telling, my work is very much in a rain and chair mode regardless.)

Some caveats: This is not to deny the glamour of new technologies, which may even rub off onto the projects which use them.  There may even be a knowledge in these technologies which is worth promulgating.  And I'm concerned with limited-domain digital art projects which do not want the mass audience which current technologies might marshal.

I'll hope to post a summing-up-of-project email before I head out.  Meantime, thank you very much for the time here!
