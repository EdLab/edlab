<p>Because online teaching is so different from in-person teaching, educators adapt different roles and approaches to their online pedagogy. This is especially the case at fully online universities as opposed to schools where teachers split their time between in-person and virtual classes. To examine online teaching approaches and practices, researchers surveyed 965 educators at the Open University of Catalonia, a fully online university based in Spain. They asked questions pertaining to teacher background, perceived classroom roles, and approaches to virtual teaching.</p>
 
<p>Among all the teachers, they found three different approaches to online teaching: content acquisition, collaborative learning, and knowledge building. Teachers who approach online classes as a place for content acquisition focus on helping students find and collect information. Teachers who focus on collaborative learning place the most importance on facilitating participation and forging social relationships between peers. Finally, teachers focused on knowledge building approach their classes as environments for knowledge construction, ensuring that students have the ability to complete tasks on their own.</p>
 
<p>The findings also show these approaches correlate with academic subjects. For instance, humanities instructors are more likely to focus on collaborative learning while science instructors are more likely to focus on content acquisition. How teachers view the goal of online learning also affects the pedagogical methods they use. Teachers who focus on knowledge building are most concerned about instructional design, whereas teachers who focus on content acquisition are most concerned about guiding their students’ use of tech. Teachers who focus on collaborative learning are most concerned with managing social interactions.</p>
 
<p>These findings can help instructors and administrators design learning environments that better fit both teacher and institutional goals. It can also help guide teacher training sessions. If an institution wants to foster a certain approach in their online courses, such as collaborative learning, institutions can train teachers in skills that would help achieve that goal, such as managing virtual social interactions. The key is to start with the desired teaching approach, then work backwards to figure out what factors help achieve that goal.</p>
