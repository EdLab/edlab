          <p>
            We're (Frederik & Doug) here live at the 
<a href="http://newmedialiteracies.org/"><b><i>New Media Literacies conference @ MIT</i></b></a>. 

I'm going to post links and thoughts, then edit this into a blog post post-conference.  

Important reading for this conference: The White Paper on Participatory Culture: MacArthur Foundation Paper by Henry Jenkins, et al:
<a href="http://www.newmedialiteracies.org/files/working/NMLWhitePaper.pdf">NML WhitePaper</a>

<b>9:48am:</b>Frederik is here! I'm here! we've joined' <a href="http://projectnml.ning.com/">the conference 'NING</a> and we're using 'Eluminate Live' for live web-conferencing. 

<b>10:03am:</b> Oh God. we had to log onto Twitter. 

<a href="https://twitter.com/#search?q=%23nml09">NML Twitter Feed</a>

they're asking if we're "tweeting for the first time"--it's kind of like the Rocky Horror Picture Show first time for 'virgins.' 

On the upside of forced acculturation, the speaker was speaking really quickly, someone tweeted 'slow down!' and she did. They also taught us '# tagging' (hash tagging). 

<b>10:38am</b> Information overload is slowly fading away...
Some insights from the "real" presentation: 

Forms of Participatory Culture:
Affiliations, Expressions, Collaborative Problem solving, Circulations

4 C's of Participatory Design: Connections, Creating, Collaborate, Circulate

<b>10:48am</b> yes, the 5+ tabs-open-on-firefox element of this conference takes a little getting used to. They're pitching/launching their tool, 'Learning Library' now:
<a href="http://newmedialiteracies.org/library/">NML Learning Library</a>

cool feature: a journal feature that tracks what people upload/challenges posted, how the media is accessed and used by other participants, and considering the question: "how would students react/participate if they realized teachers or parents were drawing on their shared or created media?" 

<b>11:32am</b> I found out all of these sessions are being live streamed online now, and will be archived, so that helps me ease up a little bit on documentation and reflection. 

<b>Workshop 1:</b> Think Tank: The Unconference Model
we're going to hear about this model and then we're going to try and 'do' it here, now over the course of the workshop. Also, we'll brainstorm ways to use this model in education--with teachers as learners, a mix of children and adults, etc. 
also interesting: someone plugged "1,000,000 Monkeys" 
<a href="http://www.1000000monkeys.com/">1,000,000 Monkeys</a>

<b>12:03pm</b> I'm in this workshop talking about modes of collaborative note-taking, blogging, information pooling, collaborative brainstorming--instead of the 'wiki' or a blog (like this one) that has to be carefully tagged and contributed to, something like Tumblr allows less barriers to access. 

In that spirit, I'm going to end live-blogging and will instead keep a Google Notebook:

<a href="http://www.google.com/notebook/public/00293129419135663286/BDRObSgoQy8aakJAk">Doug's NML Conference Google Notebook</a>

<b>13:45pm</b> Workshop about appropriation...
Definition: "Appropriation is the ability to meaningfully sample and remix content. Although the word remix is often used to talk about remixed music, remixes can be made from other content as well. A remix is simply another version, different from the original version. Many songs, paintings, videos, films, and tv shows inspire people to appropriate the original content and create new versions. New versions can be created by adding, subtracting, and/or modifying elements of the original."

We discuss our thoughts about the concept of appropriation and use the new launched "learning library" to explore the concept deeply.

Now, we're telling our stories in "six words":

<b>2:59pm</b> Ok, one more live blog from me (Doug). I think the highlight of this conference is explained best in one of the handouts they gave us: the purpose of this research institute is to "invite educators at every level and discipline" to participate in this ongoing dialogue based on their 3 research questions: how are students different? how is learning different? and how are institutions different? 

now I'm in the workshop called: "mapping in a participatory culture:Boundaries" which I obviously had to choose over the copyright talk (which will be online later, anyways).  
"How we use and teach maps changes as we have powerful new tools that change the way we see the world"
"turn loose to people the power to change things"
--Henry Jenkins on Mapping (MIT Tech TV clip)
should be interesting.
