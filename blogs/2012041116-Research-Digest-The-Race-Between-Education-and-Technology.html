Two economists, Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz, have written a new history of education in America, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Race-between-Education-Technology/dp/0674035305/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1334177692&sr=8-1 ">The Race Between Education and Technology</a>, that offers a comprehensive model for explaining changes in the national economy (with a focus upon levels of inequality) as a product of changes in the educational regime.  Although the specific arguments found in the book are not always convincing, I believe the authors have provided a few necessary conceptual tools for thinking about the role education has played in our past prosperity, and, by extension, what we will require from our educational institutions going forward. 
<!--break-->
Summary: Their basic argument is that as, over the last century or so, technological change has increasingly required the employment of higher-skilled workers, the response by educational institutions (i.e., how quickly and on what scale they've been able to provide workers with the necessary skills) has determined the productive possibilities of the economy, as well as how equally those productivity gains will be shared among American citizens.

For at least a century long period (from 1850-1960), America was the most educated nation in the world.  Goldin and Katz explain this precocity as a product of several unique qualities of our system, including its openness, forgiving nature (where in some European countries your educational future would be determined by one test in your tweens, for Americans there was always a second chance), and control by local communities as opposed to a national bureaucracy.

Starting in the 1920s, America began producing people with the skills made desirable by technological change faster than the national economy, in exploiting those new technologies, could increase demand.  This “Econ 101” framework is the titular race between education and technology, and explains why, in the period between the 20s and the 60s, income inequality dropped like a stone.  The wage-premium for a high school (or even college) education collapsed, and America developed (with a slight hiccup in the 30s, of course) broad-based middle class prosperity.

Unfortunately, the story Goldin and Katz are telling belongs in the rise and fall genre.  Beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, income inequality (along with the wage premium) began to increase, leaving us today with levels of inequality last seen in the 1920s.  The culprit, says the book, seems to be our educational system's inability to keep up with technological change.  Our secondary and tertiary educational institutions have been “losing the race” for about 40 years, by moving more and more people farther along the educational track as it had been in the past.

Edlab Relevance:

What Goldin and Katz are offering, then, is a renewed sense of urgency (if such was necessary) to the school reform movement.  Although near the end of the book they provide a few policy-reform suggestions, most of their ideas for getting more kids into college fall under the heading of “spend more money.”  When one places these fairly modest reforms against the prospect of another few decades of technological change and stagnant graduation rates, the urgent necessity of more creative thinking becomes apparent.

Of course, it's no surprise that a schooling system built send a reasonable but not excessive majority of students through high school, and a small minority through college, might currently be showing some signs of stress.  Rather than doubling down on this system, it might make more sense to loop technological change back into our educational system, instead of leaving them on parallel and competing tracks..  That is to say, allow some of this technological progress, which seems so frightening in the Goldin and Katz account, to feed back into the educational system and create more efficient and productive learning systems that will jumpstart our stagnating graduation rates.  

Now imagine Sean Connery saying “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOvH-7lcjb0">That's the Edlab way</a>”.
