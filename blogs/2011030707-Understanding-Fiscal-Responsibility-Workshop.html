          <p>
            About a week ago, I was one of 12 high school aged players from South Bronx United Soccer Club who participated in the Understanding Fiscal Responsibility (UFR) Workshop here at the EdLab. The purpose of the workshop was to teach the basics of the UFR curriculum: federal budget, national deficit and national debt to students utilizing various technological tools. This in turn would aid the student's concept of such a complex topic. The workshop was broken into four sections: pre-workshop interview, informational session, use of technology, and post workshop interview. 
            
During the pre-workshop interviews, participants were questioned about their previous knowledge of fiscal terms such as debt, budget and deficit. Participants were polled through the UFR Pressible test page on certain questions that illustrated the national debt using examples such as everyday items. Once that was accomplished, it was on to the informational session in which students received a crash course on the extent of the national debt, various factors affecting it, and several economic terms. Such terms include GDP, opportunity cost, and mandatory/discretionary spending, among others.

We were then asked to give real life examples of opportunity cost in the lives on the test page. Upon visually seeing the answers of my clubmates, I was able to get a better understanding of the meaning of opportunity cost. Next, we engaged in a class discussion via Vialogues in which we discussed a portion of a video we had just watched. This interactive approach allowed us to visually see each other's opinion pertaining to the video as well as comment on other's posts. The last tool utilized to better help us understand the debt, deficit and budget was a game called Budget Hero. Based on actual budget models from the congressional budget office, the game's objective requires the player to fill up three badges they feel are top priority. In order to try fill up these badges, users must choose cards that represent various sectors of government spending. It comes with a caveat though since participants must fill up all the badges while accumulating as little debt as possible as well as prolonging the amount of time it takes for the budget to bust. Ultimately the best score is one that has minimal debt, long budget bust, and how well your taxing and spending practices met your goals. 

Budget Hero helped me better understand that the national debt is a direct result of the government's effort to prioritize. After playing the game, it is quite a tough task considering that i tried to fulfill only three of the nine possible choices. Since Budget Hero pitted my group with other groups within the class, it brought out the inner competitor in me and my classmates which I think helps breed learning.

Finally the post workshop interviews saw each group give their feedback on what they just learned as well as the usefulness of the technological tools. Overall if we sounded more knowledgeable about the subject of the national debt than before and a reason as to why we easily attained knowledge of such a perplexed topic, I think it can be attributed to the use of technological tools.
