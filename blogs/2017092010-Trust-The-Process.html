            A lot of the literature I’ve encountered on self-directed learning focuses predominantly on resources and outcomes. An area that is given little attention but warrants further discussion is the process in which individuals go about directing their own learning. Motivation (e.g., personal, financial, professional, etc.,) is the biggest reason individuals embark on a self-directed learning journey. However, what does the self-directed learning process look like you? How do learners map out the learning goals along the journey? How do they assess every stop on the journey?

In her paper, <a href="https://siafif.com/kuliah/sukma/semester%208/SKRIPSI%20KAKAK%20TINGKAT/KEMANDIRIAN/jurnal%20kemandirian/index.pdf" target="_blank">Self-Directed Learning Revisited: A Process Perspective</a>, Virginia Ricard introduces the self-directed learning (SDL) wheel (see image). Ricard designed the SDL wheel to help learners identify the crucial steps along the SDL journey. The learner, as expected, is the central figure in the model among its three components: facilitator, setting, and resources. As the central figure, the learner must be aware that their knowledge, attitudes, and ability to navigate SDL are all essential to the SDL process. The learner will always be the central figure in the SDL process. Their attitudes, motivation, previous knowledge, skills, and overall drive to complete the learning objective are solely in the hands of the learner.

&nbsp;

I think Ricard’s model serves as a good framework for understanding the SDL process. However, the SDL process is heavily contingent upon the objectives and goals of the learner. For instance, if an individual wants to learn how to design a web page using a new technology and has prior knowledge on designing web pages, they will approach the learning process a bit differently than a novice. They might not need a facilitator nor any additional resources.

Are you aware of any other SDL models? What other components could Ricard have included in her SDL wheel?
