          <p>
            An <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/to-prevent-sexual-assault-white-house-issues-challenge-build-an-app/32205">article</a> on the Chronicle of Higher Education website alerted me to the announcement of a government challenge to build an app that would help prevent sexual assault and dating violence. As I read <a href="http://challenge.gov/HHS/199-apps-against-abuse">the description of the challenge and the vision for the app</a>, it was encouraging to see that the White House is acknowledging the problem of sexual assault and calling for action to start preventing it (as the challenge notes, there are often resources for survivors of assault on campus, yet less of an emphasis on preventing assault in the first place). 

However, I was just as soon disheartened to see that the main purpose of the app is to “allow friends to keep track of each other's whereabouts and check in frequently to avoid being isolated in vulnerable circumstances.” Aneesh Chopra, the U.S. Chief Technology Officer, says in a <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2011pres/07/20110713a.html">press release</a> that he hopes the app will “empower women who wish to communicate distress in a trusted and immediate way.” Easily getting help (especially from friends) is a way to make people feel safer and a great use of new mobile technologies, but being constantly babysat by friends via iPhone is merely telling people that, should they venture out into the big, scary world of college, they need to protect themselves from all the people looking to hurt you. How is this at all empowering? 

Something else the challenges fails to take into account is not all students have access to smartphones, and access to sexual assault prevention shouldn't be based on whether you can afford a certain kind of technology. Despite all my cynicism, though, I'm really interested to see what developers make of the challenge and for all I know it could end up being widely-used and not as silly as I think it will be. If anything, adaption of the app will bring awareness to the statistics that deemed it necessary and hopefully encourage further action among students who use it. Still, I hope that the White House is not throwing their weight behind a sexual assault prevention app as a “cool” way to avoid the most obvious route to preventing sexual assault: more comprehensive sex and consent education. We need to eliminate the mindset that victims are responsible for preventing their assault, and thus indirectly responsible for it even occurring. An app can't do that.
