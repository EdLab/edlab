<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Overall, I believe that education is a silver bullet.  Education can lift someone out of poverty and has the potential to change a family’s destiny in one generation.  I know first hand the power of education because I am a first generation American.  My mother came here from Argentina and struggled to raise me as a single mother on welfare in Hell’s Kitchen, New York.  Education was the foundation that helped me be successful.  Now I have two kids, and my daughter is in her third year of college and just assumed she was going because I went.  That’s the power education can bring and I want everyone to have that opportunity.
<p>
I have a Bachelor's degree in Political Science and Communications, and a Master’s in Public Policy, but real education happens when you experience the world.  I try to keep my experiences new as much as possible.  I worked for the Governor of New York, spent six years at Accenture and worked in the utility field, banking industry, healthcare, and electronics and high technology space. 
<p>
I remember graduating from college and thinking, "I’m done, I don’t have to learn anything else again!"  Nothing is further from the truth.  Getting a "degree" isn’t the end of your education, it is just the beginning.  If you aren’t learning, you aren’t growing and developing.
<p>
Now we have all the world’s information at our fingertips.  We can learn in school, from teachers, from experts all over the world, from each other.  Technology and the web give us an opportunity to redefine what learning looks like.  We can create a generation of lifelong learners!
<p>
We have to always keep in mind that we are raising a generation that will solve problems we haven’t identified yet, with technology and advancements that haven’t been discovered yet, in roles we haven’t created. 
<p>

<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I’ve been at Google for 7 years.  I believe I have learned more at Google in the last 7 years than I did in my previous 30! 
<p>
At Google I learned to think big and reach for the impossible.  I also learned that I was only as smart as the people I collaborated with.  Together, my small team has done some amazing things and we continue to push further, not settling. 
<p>
Our team also has the support of everyone at Google who believes in what we are trying to accomplish. 
<p>

<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> I think we are at the point where we need to stop debating if we should be using technology in education and focus our energy on making sure we are successful in how we use technology in education.  Like every other industry, technology is changing the learning landscape, whether we want it to or not.
<p>
It’s very important to remember that technology is not the silver bullet.  Great education is the silver bullet.  Technology and the web are there to support and enable great education.
<p>
Our job is to make sure these tools are as easy as possible to use, manage, and scale.  Our challenge is to make the tools useful and invisible at the same time.  
<p>

<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I could talk about this all day but I’ll focus on two.
<p><b>1)  What we learn changes:</b><br>
When I was growing up, our entire community had one library we all shared.  Every school, public and private, and all the residents in Hell’s Kitchen had the Columbus Library on 51st Street and 10th Ave.  It was a small library with half the books it should have had.  It was not the most comprehensive resource center. 
</p> 
Today, we have 10,000 Columbus libraries in our pockets!  Technology and the web force us to redefine what being educated looks like. 
<p> 
Educators no longer have to be the magic box of information.  Because the information is at our fingertips, teachers can focus on a more important job, helping kids convert information into intelligence. 
<p> 
I believe we will stop giving students credit for something they look up, and instead give them credit for demonstrating intelligence. 
<p>
<b>2) How we learn changes:</b><br>
The web generation is here and learning in ways that are fundamentally different than how we learned.
<p>
Think about a five year old.  Now think about a device you use and realize that device is the worst technology that 5 year old will ever see in their lives.  It’s their Commodore 64.  They are going to be in their late 20s and find your device in some box at a garage sale, buy it for 50 cents, and put it up on a shelf like a museum piece. 
<p> 
These are the kids coming into our schools today.  Do you think our current education model is ready for them?  Technology is not new to this generation.  Like electricity for our generation, they just flick it on and it works.  It’s always been there.  We can use this to our advantage.  
<p> 
Also, we now have a lot more information in the learning science space.  This information suggests quite clearly that the current "factory model" of education is not preparing our students to develop the core knowledge, skills, and abilities they will need to thrive as adults in this new global economy.  There is sufficient evidence that shows we all learn in different ways. 
<p>
We know there is a lot more value in creating personalized, engaging, and relevant education.  Technology can help us with these concepts in so many ways.
<p> 
We will see how we are educated shift from rows in a classroom where everyone is listening to the person in front of the class, to a more collaborative environment where students are grouped into competency groups, no matter their age, and will build intelligence based on their preferred learning style. 
<p>

<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> My job is to think about how technology and the web can be utilized in education.  I work across all our teams involved in education to help them think through what’s possible.  I also work with educators and decision makers who want to understand our vision and our approach to what we are doing in education.
<p>
My "next big project" is a lot of the same.  I want to continue to see educators take advantage of our tools, especially now, as they create the new learning models we are seeing taking shape. 
<p>
Google Apps for Education is being used by more than 25 million users and educators are using Google Apps in ways that foster collaboration and learning in ways we couldn’t have dreamt up ourselves.  Schools recognize the importance of having an infrastructure so teachers, staff, students, and parents can communicate and collaborate.  The technology to run such an infrastructure on premise is expensive!  With Google Apps, the whole thing lives in the cloud and it’s easy to setup and use.  It’s also free, and that goes a long way with school budgets today.
<p>
Educators also encourage their students to use Google Apps because it helps them communicate, collaborate, and be creative.  Educators recognize how important these skills are for students. 
<p> 
We have Chromebooks in more than 3,000 schools and the list keeps growing!  Students and teachers love Chromebooks because they are easy to use, boot up in seconds, have long battery lives, and can be used by multiple students.
<p> 
Administrators love Chromebooks because they are easy to manage and deploy, whether it is for 30 students in a classroom or 30,000 students in a school district.  
<p>
I want us to keep building tools that support and enable teachers in the classroom or whatever learning environment they are in.  We have to make sure they are easy to use, manageable, and scalable across any learning environment.  Teachers should not be teaching technology, they should be using technology to teach.
