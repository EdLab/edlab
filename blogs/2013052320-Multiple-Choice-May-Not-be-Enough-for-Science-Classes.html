<p><b>Title:</b> Multiple-Choice Exams: An Obstacle for Higher-Level Thinking in Introductory Science Classes (2012)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Kathrin F. Stanger-Hall & Eric H. Chudler</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Testing literature suggests that multiple choice and the memorization-based study strategies associated with this test form require minimal critical thinking. Students tend to characterize higher-level multiple choice questions as "tricky" rather than challenging because they do not require higher-level thinking skills. <a href="http://www.lifescied.org/content/11/3/294.abstract">Multiple-Choice Exams: An Obstacle for Higher-Level Thinking in Introductory Science Classes</a> studied use of the multiple choice exam format in an introductory biology class. The authors expected that testing with short answer questions in addition to multiple choice would change how students studied, enhance learning outcomes, and improve student performance on critical thinking questions. As part of the course, students were taught <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom's_Taxonomy">Bloom’s Taxonomy</a>, encouraged to design their own study questions at all Bloom levels, and told to practice higher-level thinking skills while studying. The instructor also demonstrated with examples of higher-level thinking skills during class, but students in this study were not specifically trained to respond to short answer questions.</p>

<p>Biology majors in an introductory course were asked if they preferred multiple choice, short answer, or a combination of the two on final exams, how many hours per week they usually studied for a science class during exam weeks and during non–exam weeks, and to report their current grade point average. At the midpoint of the course, students were asked how much they had actually studied for the biology class during the previous (non-exam) week and which study behaviors they had used. In the introductory biology class, one section was assessed with exams in the traditional multiple choice format and the other section was assessed with a combination of multiple choice and short answer questions.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
Results showed that a mixed exam format of multiple choice and short answer was correlated with more cognitively active study behaviors and significantly better performance on the cumulative final exam. The authors also found less gender-bias in the short answer questions. The overall results suggest that the multiple choice exam format hindered critical thinking in the introductory science class testing group. The authors suggest that administering mixed format exams in introductory science classes could potentially improve retention of female students and encourage their pursuit of a career in STEM by reducing testing bias.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
This study design and its findings do not seem very innovative, but they may push researchers to think more deeply about mixed method testing strategies for large classes. Introductory science courses tend to rely on multiple choice testing to quickly assess large groups of students, but the technology to computer-grade short answer and essay questions is already <a href="http://dianeravitch.net/2012/11/15/should-computers-grade-essays/">in development</a>. Further research could investigate online testing and the ideal ratio of question formats to yield an efficient evaluation and maximize students' learning. With greater creativity and the application of technology there’s no reason why we should not implement testing strategies that encourage and assess critical thinking skills, even in large classes.</p>
