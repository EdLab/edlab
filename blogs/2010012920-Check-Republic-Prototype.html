            To install Check Republic and see a screencast of it in action, please click <a href=" http://jetpackgallery.mozillalabs.com/jetpacks/323">here</a>.<br>
After installation, please go to the <a href="http://zapatopi.net/treeoctopus/">Pacific Tree Octopus site</a> to see a site with sample ratings. <br>
<br>Check Republic, an information literacy add-on for middle and high school students, was created in response to the growing number of students who use the Internet as their primary source of information. The current features, as well as a discussion of next development steps, of the Jetpack code and the Check Republic site are included below.<br><br><b> Jetpack for PhP Developers</b><br>Our <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/3579">team</a> is comprised of educators, designers and PHP developers. Since we do not have experience with javascript, we decided to make a Jetpack for PHP pages. Our Jetpack:
<li>Passes key variables (url, document title and selection) that can be used in a variety of ways to a PHP page.
<li>Through its simplicity, can be understood (and reused) without a background in javascript. Other teams can use our Jetpack by modifying one line of code: the slidebar url.
<li> Was created to help ease people into Jetpack development who may not have  experience with javascript. 
<li>While very brief, showcases the potential of Jetpack by using only Jetpack features rather than traditional lengthy javascript. </li><br>
<i>Next Steps for Our Jetpack</i><br>
We would like to add a small icon next to selections that have been previously rated by other users. Users could click on this icon and view comments related to the selection. <br><br>
<b>The Check Republic Slidebar</b><br><br>
The main goal of Check Republic is to get students to think about the validity of information they view online (information literacy). Our team is not interested in creating final verdicts for any site. Rather, we wish to create opportunities for students to think critically about online information by reading comments of other users, cross-checking facts from other sites and adding their own review of site information. <br>
<i>Features of Check Republic:</i>
<li>When users visit a new site, previous ratings of the site content are summarized using three easy to interpret icons. 
<li>The default view  of the site shows all comments of previous users. 
<li>Users can add a rating, a supporting/disproving citation url, and a comment for any selection for the page.
<li>Error messages are written in clear, kid-friendly language to avoid confusion.
<li>The design of the site is clean and easy to use without being childish. This was done to appeal to young users without excluding adult users from using the site. No redesign will be necessary for this site to be used with a wide age range. </li><br>
<i>Next Steps for Check Republic</i>
<li>Users will be able to create groups and comments/ratings can be viewed by group members only. This will help restrict comments to specific students for class projects.
<li>Teachers will be able to create accounts for students who do not have email addresses. 
<li>Comments will be sortable by date, user, selection, and rating. Currently comments are only viewable in reverse chronological order. 
<li>Users will be able to respond to comments made by other users. 
<li>Any rated selection will have a clickable icon that will display all comments and ratings for that selection. </li><br>
<i>Known Bugs</i>
<li>Users do not have to log in to comment, making comment tracking difficult.
<li>You have to scroll to the bottom of the page to access the register and account management links. 
<li>Users can submit a comment without a rating or supporting citation.</li>
