<p>Sure, there are courses you can take, programs you can complete, and websites you can peruse, but with <a href="https://getmimo.com">Mimo</a>, you can learn to code on the go. This app contains dozens of bite-sized lessons that help you learn how to code with various programming languages, build websites, and develop apps.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>For just one app, Mimo offers many different courses; 16 to be specific. While three of these are not specifically on coding languages (introduction to programming, Git, and cybersecurity), the remaining 13 are. These lessons focus on the most common languages used in programming, such as Swift, Python, and Java. Each subject is comprised of mini-lessons, some with as many as 300. Even for beginners, the lessons are easy to follow and well-paced. Users not only learn how to code, but also why a specific language is formatted as it is. This extra level of understanding makes the learning stickier.</p>
 
<p>In addition, Mimoâ€™s interface and logistical setup make the app easy to use. Upon opening the app for the first time, users can set a daily practice goal and receive reminders and progress charts to track their success. Mimo also provides a clear description of each subject, its difficulty level, and the amount of time it should take you to fully complete it. Mimo guides you through the app with a clear direction and helps you establish concrete learning goals.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The only negative aspect of Mimo is that only the first lesson of each subject is free. If you want to use the app to learn a full coding language, you will have to subscribe. Although all the information in Mimo can be found freely online, learners who prefer structured lessons will likely find the price worthwhile. A monthly subscription is roughly the same price as Hulu, but a strong argument can be made that learning Java could propel a career forward more than binge watching the Big Bang Theory.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>For anyone committed to learning more about computer science or a specific programming language, Mimo could be the right app for you. This is especially true if you are busy and want to fit short lessons into your schedule on the go. Trust me, your long commute will thank you if you pepper it with Python.</p>
