          <p>
            Last Thursday, the amazing Sonia Nieto graciously spoke at the 3rd Annual Edmund Gordon Lecture. Dr. Nieto is a 2014 Recipient of Teachers college Medal for Distinguished Service. In this lecture, Professor Nieto reflected on her life as a teacher, curriculum developer, mentor, ethnic studies instructor, researcher, and professor of teacher education by drawing a number of significant lessons about public education and its future for the most vulnerable students as well as for the nation. The event was thrown by the Institute for Urban and Minority Education (IUME) here at Teachers College, where I am currently a research fellow. 

Before she gave the lecture to the broader Teachers College community I was given the opportunity to facilitate a panel discussion between Sonia Nieto and some very accredited faculty/staff and Ph.D. students in the IUME Conference Room. I felt blessed to be so engaged with a flow of dialect, intelligence and general concern for a universal cause. Some topics that were covered in the panel discussion revolved around culturally relevant/responsive pedagogy, the school-to-prison pipeline, the New Jim Crow, police brutality and the effect on self-perception of urban and minority youth, and the true meaning of social justice.

While the topics being covered were very relevant and pressing issues of this time, what I took away most from this experience was beyond the flow of valuable information. The whole experience reminded me how important and beneficial it is to have so many credible and revolutionary researchers, scholars, teachers and activists all together in one room focused on one topic. It was beautiful to see the ways in which each professor and student had their own specific field of work that still was so applicable to the topic of the lecture. By pulling from their knowledge and seeing how it fits amongst the knowledge of others, the conversation was not only able to flow naturally, but we were able to reach depths of discussion that would not be possible with out that level of collaboration. 

It reminded me of the work we do here at EdLab and how grateful I am to be a part of it. We all are focused on our own specific duties, (whether it is publishing, coding, community outreach, etc.) but we are all working parts of EdLab as a whole. We are all pieces to the puzzle and the work being done here is 100% a collaborative effort of part time and full time staff; of sociologists and economists; of innovators and decision makers. It was great to hear HuiSoo give some history of where EdLab a couple of weeks ago because now we can continue on and see where EdLab is going. Thank you all for the collaborative effort so far and I look forward to what the future holds!
