            <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/nyregion/john-sexton-is-tested-by-nyu-faculty.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&hp">Dr. John Sexton</a>, president of NYU, is admired by many of his intellectual peers as a hero who has transformed the university. His many efforts in expanding the college has earned him international recognition and praise and he has even been awarded a raise in his salary from $773,000 to $1.5 million. Though admired as a model leader, many of his faculty see him otherwise and are against his style of leadership. This is because Sexton has disregarded major faculty oppositions regarding his decisions for the school. During his years as president of NYU, Sexton has made many advances including:
<ul>
<li>a campaign which raised $3 billion for the school</li>
<li>establishment of the Global Network University (made up of 12 international centers including Accra, Ghana, Buenos Aires, Paris, Abu Dhabi)</li>
<li>a push for N.Y.U. 2031, a plan to build six million square feet of facilities in New York City</li>
</ul>

NYU 2031 is Sexton's most controversial policy by far as it has been approved by the city though a majority of the faculty members disapproved of it in a survey taken last year. A decision on Sextons presidency will come to its pinnacle this week as a five day vote of no confidence has been scheduled by the faculty of Arts and Science, NYU's largest school.
