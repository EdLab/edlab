<p>With all the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/02/obamas-push-for-computer-science-education/459276/">latest initiatives</a> to <a href="http://hechingerreport.org/how-one-school-district-works-computational-thinking-into-every-grade-and-class/">push STEM in every school</a> across the country, it’s no wonder that more research is being done on STEM-related pedagogy. Educators are increasingly emphasizing engineering practices in the classroom; some are even finding ways to get students actively engaged in STEM <a href="http://hechingerreport.org/the-stem-pipelines-giant-hole-starts-before-kindergarten/">as early as kindergarten</a>.</p>
 
<p>Researchers from Texas contributed to this search for a better understanding of STEM in schools by focusing on robotics in education. They examined elementary and middle schoolers in a summer robotics camp to see how those students approached and thought about robots. In small groups, the campers worked on LEGO Mindstorms NXT robotics kits to complete challenges designed by the camp instructors. For example, one challenge was a sumo robot competition, where the robots attempted to push each other out of the ring.</p>
 
<p>The authors of this study found that students used two frameworks for understanding robotics engineering, systems thinking and embodied cognition. Systems thinking is based on thinking about the robot as a whole made up of connected parts, whereas embodied cognition attempts to understand the robot through the students’ own physicality. For example, one student observed that the brain of the robot is required to make it run, and that the motors and tires are all connected to the brain in order to function.</p>
 
<p>This study has significant implications in engineering instruction and STEM as a whole in schools. As educators work to develop curriculum and lessons in STEM, it will be important for them to consider the ways in which students naturally develop understandings of robots, which are typically more removed from their everyday lives and experiences. As such, they should incorporate the knowledge that students perform well when thinking about a robot as a whole composed of related parts, and as something that has analogous components to their own bodies. There is still much more to be considered when implementing STEM practices in the classroom, and this is one way in which educators can consider how to best teach robotics and engineering to their students.</p>
