<p>With more classrooms taking place in virtual settings, it’s important to ask whether avid gamers have an advantage over others in a virtual classroom. Specifically, a new study examined whether non-gamers and women (who traditionally have played video games less than men) are at a disadvantage in the virtual world classroom.</p>
 
<p>Researchers designed a virtual world classroom and examined the behavior and reactions of 348 undergrad students in a business class. They specifically examined students' sense of presence in the virtual classroom, which researchers have found often determines how connected students feel to the class as well as how successfully they learn. Therefore, a greater sense of presence generally leads to a better virtual class experience.</p>
 
<p>The authors of the study feared that gamers and men would have an advantage over non-gamers and women in a virtual classroom because they are in general more familiar with virtual settings, avatars, and in-game interactions. They also feared that people with more computer experience would fare better than those with less.</p>
 
<p>In their findings, the researchers noted no difference in sense of presence between male and female students, nor between those with greater computer experience and those with less. There was, however, a slight difference between gamers and non-gamers, as those in the latter category felt less able to fully immerse themselves in the virtual experience. That said, the authors felt the disadvantage was too small to be a real concern.</p>

<p>Overall, this study squelched the fear that gamers, people with greater computer experience, and men would have a significant advantage over other students in a virtual classroom. The students’ sense of presence was comparable across the board. Because of this, the study suggests that educators can confidently implement a virtual world classroom without fear of disadvantaging students who have less computer or gaming experience.</p>
