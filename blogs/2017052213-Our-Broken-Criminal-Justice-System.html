The third week of the course was super interesting. The readings and multimedia focused on our broken criminal justice system. I will reflect on the YouTube video above from the syllabus as it was the content piece that most grabbed my attention.

The video focused on the racial disparities in the system. For instance, there is no secret that minorities account for the majority of prisoners in our criminal justice system. This points to a deeper societal and socioeconomic problem. Additionally, a considerable amount of individuals behind bars are actually innocent. One of the major reasons is that individuals (either through their will or bad legal advice), tend to accept plea deals instead of proceeding to a jury trial. The punishment for accepting a plea is on average nine times less than what you would receive if found guilty at trial.

The video was very compelling and I could see it generating interesting discourse in the classroom. These topics are very important and essential to not just our criminal justice system, but our way of government. It is during these instances that I wish there was an in-person component to this class. I would have very much enjoyed the discussion. As I alluded to in my previous post, this class lends itself very nicely to a hybrid form that includes online and in-person. The video content and readings have been very interesting and have generated a lot of ideas, questions, and thoughts in my mind. I would have very much appreciated the opportunity to have a discussion with fellow classmates.
