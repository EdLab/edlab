          <p>
            Ramadan is in full swing and my body and mind has yet to fully adjust. During the last four days, I usually go to the mosque every night from 9:45- 11pm for a series of prayers, and socialization before heading home for the night. Since Islam observes the lunar calendar, Ramadan keeps moving up in months and for me as a high school soccer player, the timing couldn't be worse. My high school finished last season ranked #3 in the country by Gatorade and ESPN and we are one of the favorites for the national title this season and as such, I had planned to devote some time to training and conditioning for the season. Though I am fasting, I have been able to muster whatever energy I have left to attend high school practices, as I want to be in somewhat decent shape when the season starts in five weeks time.
 
According to the custom of Islam, you are prohibited from fasting only if it interferes with your professional life or occupation as that it is the means by which one supports his or her family. This is certainly true for most of the Muslim athletes who will be competing in the forthcoming Olympic games as well as professional soccer players in Europe who are prepping for their respective seasons. Though professional life can excuse one from fasting, they must still make it up at a later time if possible. Since I am not a professional athlete, I don't have the “professional” excuse to skip Ramadan and must either skip training sessions or go through its rigors. Since this season represents my last shot at another city title and a national championship plus college recruitment opportunities, I don't have much choice but to prep for the season and be in top physical condition.
