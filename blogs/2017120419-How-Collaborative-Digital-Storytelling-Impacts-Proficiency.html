<p>As globalization evolves, English proficiency becomes a critical competence, challenging classroom teachers to design lessons that align with varying levels of proficiency. In this way advanced students remain engaged, and elementary learners are not left behind. Digital storytelling is an effective teaching tool for young EFL learners, but little is known about its benefits for students of different proficiency levels. </p>
 
<p>In this study, researchers used a collaborative storytelling activity to examine students’ flow perception use (depth of involvement and level of enjoyment), learning strategies, and pair performance in relation to their English proficiency level. The data were collected over a 17-month period, to identify the changing patterns in student engagement, from 42 third graders, 9-10 years, in urban Taiwan. The students were grouped into 21 pairs based on their entry English proficiency and then grouped again into high, mid, or low proficiency. The pairs shared an iPad and worked together to retell stories using their own English sentences and drawings. Each week they published their stories on a Web 2.0 platform.</p>
 
<p>Researchers found that high-proficient students’ flow perceptions decreased over time due to the lack of sense of accomplishment and the extra burden of playing the guiding role in the pair. The opposite occurred in the low and mid-proficient students. And mid-proficient students, but not high-proficient students, excelled in learning strategy use (memory, compensation, cognitive, metacognitive, social). This was surprisingly inconsistent with literature that suggests advanced students tend to be more engaged and apply more learning strategies.</p>
 
<p>The findings support the low-threshold-high-ceiling principle (that novice students work toward complex skills while higher-proficient students are free to practice advanced skills), and suggest that collaborative activities should ensure students of different proficiency share the same goals, while allowing different types of participation to maximize their engagement. Researchers hope the findings can address the issue of proficiency differences in EFL classrooms and serve as a reference for future research of EFL collaborative storytelling activities.</p>
