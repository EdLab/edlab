<p><i>"The Right Question Institute (RQI) is a non-profit educational organization offering what many people consider to be the simplest, most powerful strategy available for helping people in low and moderate-income communities learn to advocate for themselves, participate in decisions that affect them and partner with service-providers and public officials. RQI’s innovative methods are delivered through educational, health care, social service, community-based organizations and public agencies all over the country and beyond."</i> (<a href="http://rightquestion.org/about/">About Us - The Right Question Institute</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Educational Resources</b></p>

<p><a href="http://rightquestion.org/">The Right Question Institute</a>’s mission focuses on two tenets: teaching people how to ask questions and advocating the concept of "microdemocracy," which centers around the idea that individual people are prominent and influential players in the decision-making processes of public agencies. The RQI provides educational resources for the former tenant in a variety of contexts—businesses, education, healthcare, and voter engagement—with the goal of teaching people how to self-advocate by asking effective questions.</p>

<p><b>For the Classroom</b></p>
 
<p>In the education sector specifically, the RQI provides resources centered around what the organization calls the Question Formulation Technique (QFT). These resources are free to all who sign up through their network and are developed separately for students, professional development, teacher preparation, and parents. The QFT resource for educators, for instance, breaks down the process of facilitating question asking into steps and provides a template for practicing the method before introducing it into the classroom. There are also additional tips, templates, and worksheets provided in the Educator Network. The RQI also hosts conferences for education professionals to discuss and dissect the question asking process.</p>

<p><b>For Microdemocracy</b></p>

<p>Another area that the RQI focuses on is accountability in a democracy. It seeks to provide resources, specifically its Right Question Strategy, to help citizens ask probing and relevant questions about their communities in order to hold decision-makers accountable. The RQI rationalizes that the need for this skill is present in everything from healthcare to welfare, and that once people can confidently ask questions about these things, they will be empowered as citizens within their communities.</p>
