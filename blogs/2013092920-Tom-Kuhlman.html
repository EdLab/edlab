<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b>
I used to be in the marketing industry. But somewhere in the process I had the idea to become a world famous video producer. So I quit my job and went to school to learn video production. Apparently, they only hire talented people in that industry so that didn’t work out for me.
<p>
I did end up in training doing a lot of multimedia production for a healthcare group’s education department. From there I transitioned to the corporate training industry so I had more control over the projects. One of the key influencers for me in the transition was Etienne Wenger and his book on communities of practice. I really enjoyed the thought of social learning.
<p>
Ironically, years later as I was working on my Masters in Educational Technology, I did a research project on communities of practice and came back to Wenger’s work. For my research, I focused on the Articulate user community since it was something I was familiar with. I looked at the impact of sharing personal expertise to become a more involved community participant. From there I ended up a community MVP because I was always sharing and ended up getting hired to manage the Articulate community.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?  <br>

<b>Answer:</b> After high school I joined the military and served four years as a finance specialist. At that time I really didn’t enjoy the military, but looking back I realized that it helped me mature and taught me a lot about working with others. Had I gone to college right out of high school I’m not sure if I’d have stuck around; which is probably true for many of today’s students transitioning from high school to college.
<p>
After I graduated from my corporate media program, working for a healthcare group with no money helped me learn to be resourceful and creative. Many of the things I share in my blog, the community, and in workshops are the result of that time. There’s a lot of value in having no resources and being forced to work around issues and resolving them with what you have.
<p> 
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 


<b>Answer:</b> I manage the <a href="http://community.articulate.com/">E-Learning Heroes community</a> which has about 107,000 members. I also write the <a href="http://www.articulate.com/rapid-elearning/about-tom/">Rapid E-Learning Blog</a> which has about 105,000 subscribers. For our industry, that’s pretty big. People join both because they have needs. So I hope that the work I do has a positive impact in meeting the needs of those in our community.
<p>
Currently I work for a software vendor. One of our goals is to create software that empowers users to craft better learning experiences without requiring advanced programming skills. We’ve been doing well on that front. I believe the software we create has democratized course development and put the power into the hands of people who in the past didn’t have access to what the tools provide.
<p>
However, easy course design does introduce some issues. One is that because anyone can create a course, there are a lot who do with limited instructional design skills. This tends to mean there are a lot of courses out there that could probably be designed better. So we’re committed to helping people build better courses.
<p>
A lot of what we focus on is less about our tools and more about general E-Learning design. I believe that’s one of the reasons the blog and community are so large. People know if they’re being sold or manipulated. If we did that, they’d leave.
<p>
We also feel an obligation to be contributors to the E-Learning community in general. The more we can do to push things forward and help others learn, the more we’ll all be successful. That’s a win-win in my book.
<p>
<b>Question:</b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? <br>

<b>Answer:</b> As far as trends, mobile is obviously the big one. With today’s smart phones and tablets, it truly is amazing that we can carry such powerful computers around to address our immediate whims. From a learning perspective it allows us to pull what we need at the point of need. Of course, this may have long term implications if we don’t retain things or learn to process without immediate help. As a father of two, I look at my children and wonder if they’ll learn to appreciate those things that require more diligence or discipline. They’re growing up in a world with instant access to everything. Somewhere, it strips the wonder from life.
<p> 
Mobile and online technology also helps even the playing field for those in developing nations. Some cultures really prize education. And to have an entry to a lot of what’s available from some of the world’s best schools is pretty exciting.
<p> 
Open education is also a trend of significance. Currently we have it via informal learning as anyone can research and learn almost anything today. However, the move to formalize or structure the learning experience is the developing trend. This also introduces many issues as it disrupts what we think about paid and public education. I’m sure it impacts those who are tenured or unionized as they have to wrestle with the paradigm shift and change in the public’s expectations and appetite. Ultimately, the consumer always gets control. So how will those enterprises that have been guardians of education (usually at a premium, I may add) deal with an open environment where value may be dictated by more than reputation and cost.
<p>
<b>Question:</b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Since I manage a vibrant online community, I’m always looking to make the E-Learning Heroes community more valuable to those who participate. That’s what I’m working on. We’ve got some cool things planned. Stay tuned.
