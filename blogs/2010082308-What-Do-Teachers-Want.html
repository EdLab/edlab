          <p>
            I came across a blog and <a href="http://www.iear.org/iear/2010/8/13/what-do-teachers-really-want-in-an-educational-app.html"> specific blog entry for IAER.org (I Education Apps Review)</a> through another post by our friends at Startl. The entry above specifically talks about what teachers are looking for in new educational apps. All of the points were interesting and informative. I found the following idea to be especially poignant:

"Apps need to continue to be developed that allow students and teachers to access their cloud computing resources. Specifically, Google Education Apps are making a big impact in schools and yet mobile learning devices struggle with accessing that information effectively and efficiently.As new initiatives come online, they need to work well with multiple platforms."

The point about multi-modal learning experiences is right on the mark. Sometimes, app developers focus too much on platform, believing that there are some apps designed for a PC/Web application, while others may be more appropriate for mobile learning. There's clearly a lack of emphasis on multi-modal learning, where an application "lives" on multiple devices with possibly different focuses on each. 

Our work around online video and learning is a good case in this regard. I think the web is a much more natural tool for collaboration and long-form editing and content production. Mobile devices are ideal for content consumption and more short-form content development. So, as we develop out tools like Critter, it's important to think about what opportunities a mobile version might provide compared to a web version. It may not be ideal for writing long comments, but may be great for letting users watch videos while they travel, make short and quick comments, or even respond to simple surveys about a particular video.
