          <p>
            The world of education presents us with many situations, some that we can control and others we simply cannot. State and federal governments have big power and control in the way the system works than ever before. This is rather unfortunate as research proves that <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/finding_common_ground/2013/09/multiple_measures_matter_more_when_they_include_teacher_autonomy.html">teacher autonomy</a> is very important because having control over your own profession shows a lot of positive impact, especially in the field of education. Student control over their learning is very much correlated with the teachers understanding of the subject they are teaching and the best teachers are usually those who incorporate their ideologies, studies and experiences in their work. Too often, administrators are easy to include only the elements they view as important and ignore what the teachers think. The goals of the teachers are as important as students and parents and what the committee thinks should be done to improve the system.

In order to attain this professional freedom, teachers must prove why autonomy is important. Teachers should be held accountable and given the opportunity to improvise their goals in the curriculum through teacher evaluations. This all comes down to trust and confidence the administrators have in their teachers and the trust teachers have in their students. Teachers have spent years practicing their craft and it is fair to hear their voices on issues concerning their classrooms and true and authentic measures allow for that.
