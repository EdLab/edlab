            <p>Learn more about the <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/public-interest-technology/university-network/" target="_blank">Public Interest Technology University Network. </a></p><p><br /></p><p>Here is the specific <a href="https://provost.columbia.edu/content/public-interest-tech-challenge" target="_blank">call for proposals</a>.</p><p><br /></p><p>Here are some initial thoughts/ideas:</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>(1) Objectives</strong></p><p>The project will engage university students and alums with secondary school students in the NY region to initiate, develop, and deliver public interest technology projects with demonstrable outcomes.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>(2) Method and process to meet those objectives</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Online Components</p><p>Online networks offer the capacity to involve a wider range of individuals than might participate in wholly face-to-face activities, even over the relatively proximate distances of a metropolitan area. The online components of the project will be particularly useful for engaging secondary school students and university alumni who are not on campus. Moreover, creating the project network online will allow it to scale across participating institutions and areas after the prototype phase.</p><p><br /></p><p>The online components of the project will be designed to support project work while building community resources for the prototype network and beyond. Accordingly, the online site will include:</p><p><br /></p><p>A – Content resources such as readings, lessons, available data sets, and bios on persons in</p><p>the network. The content assets on the network will provide a foundation for learning (Chae, Cocciolo, Hughes &amp; Natriello, 2008). Such assets will include those specifically created for beginners to make it easy for them to join the network and become active project participants. Bio information for members of the network will highlight the human resources available to members of the network (Anwar, Chae, &amp; Natriello, 2010).</p><p><br /></p><p>B – News of project opportunities and emerging project teams looking for additional members. All members of the network will be welcome to submit news items, but the items will reviewed for completeness and appropriateness by the community manager.</p><p><br /></p><p>C – Project Cases – To start, the project staff will develop several project case studies to</p><p>demonstrate the nature of potential projects. These case studies will be designed to provide readily accessible models for all members of the network. Over time, projects developed by network members will be developed into case studies to build out a more complete range of illustrative projects. Each project case will include project outcomes, products, and assessments of impact.</p><p><br /></p><p>Face-to-Face Components</p><p>While online networks can extend the reach of interactions on the public service technology projects envisioned for this initiative, such networks are enhanced and strengthened by periodic face-to-face gatherings where members of the network can interact more fully and develop the kind of professional relationships that will sustain and support public service work moving forward (Natriello, 2015). Accordingly, the proposed project will offer such face-to-face opportunities on a bi-monthly basis.</p><p><br /></p><p>These face-to-face encounters will vary in form and format to support the development of projects in their various phases. Examples include:</p><p><br /></p><p>Design Event – A one-day session in which members of the network come together to form project teams and prototype (e.g., <a href="http://rhizr.com/rz/AtCdh4AXbiRyW2SiE/ffss-fall-2017-" target="_blank">http://rhizr.com/rz/AtCdh4AXbiRyW2SiE/ffss-fall-2017-</a>design-event).</p><p><br /></p><p>EditJam – A half-day or evening session in which project teams come together to write up the results of their project activities (e.g., <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/18593)" target="_blank">https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/18593)</a> .</p><p><br /></p><p>Project Exhibition – An session in which project teams present the results of their project work to an audience of invited outsiders (e.g., (e.g., <a href="http://rhizr.com/rz/wCEfwFLSZnWjzhWec/tc-digital-" target="_blank">http://rhizr.com/rz/wCEfwFLSZnWjzhWec/tc-digital-</a>learning-showcase).</p><p><br /></p>
