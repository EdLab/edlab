<a href="http://www.socrative.com/">Socrative</a> is an easy to use “student response system” for creating quick student engagement. The program seems to work on basically any device, provided it's connected to the internet.  The teacher logs into the control center, creates a room, and chooses activities for everyone in the “room” to follow.  The basic use seems to be as a quick real-time quiz, although there are a few “game” type options.  
<!--break-->
<b>Pros</b>:
The teacher gets immediate feedback for his quiz, and that, coupled with the ease and speed with which a quiz can be administered, could allow for a much tighter feedback loop, and better on-the-fly adjustments of what is to be taught. The program also makes it easy to collect and organize data on student performance.

<b>Cons</b>:
It's fairly limited.  First, everyone in the class has to somehow be on the internet, and second, you can only use it for short-answer multiple choice quizzes.

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>:
Although its tempting to look at an ipad and try to think up all of the amazing, complex educational programs students will be able to run on it, one under-discussed advantage of technology in the classroom is the ability to more quickly and efficiently get through the mundane, everyday tasks (such as, for instance, printing and handing out quiz sheets).  

<b>Our Takeaway</b>: 
Socrative has some potential, but at the moment it strikes me as a little ahead of the times.  Perhaps in the future it can play an important part in creating a more flexible and dynamic classroom.
