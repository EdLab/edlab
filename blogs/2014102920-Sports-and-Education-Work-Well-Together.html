            Sports if sometimes depicted as a form of distraction for students. However, research shows that sports have help students in broadening their knowledge and exposes them to several learning techniques. This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/10/21/taking-sports-out-of-school-2/sports-and-education-work-well-together" target = "blank">article</a>  argues that student athletes tend to perform better in school and in life. Research found that schools that offer a lot of successful sports programs tend to produce higher test scores and graduation rates as well as lower drop out rates.
<p>
Though sports seem a part of student life (especially at the secondary and collegiate level) in the US, it is almost nonexistent in some countries. Countries such as South Korea and Finland do not have athletics in their schools. This may one of the reasons why these countries have some of the best education systems in the world.  Even though this might be true, this article explains that some low-achieving countries also lack sports programs. In this case, it is very evident that, the academic excellence of South Korea as a country cannot be solely attributed to their schools not having sports programs.
<p>
I believe it is a good experience for every student to try a sport. It helps them to learn things that will prove beneficial to them in later on in life such as discipline, punctuality, teamwork, and collaboration, among others.
