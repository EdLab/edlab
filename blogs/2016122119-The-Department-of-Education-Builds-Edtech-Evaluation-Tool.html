<p><i>"With more classrooms than ever connected to high-speed Wi-Fi as a result of the President’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/k-12/connected">ConnectED initiative</a>, it is imperative to create an evidence-based process to determine the effectiveness of technology apps used in the classroom."</i> (<a href="http://tech.ed.gov/rce/">Office of Education Technology </a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Edtech Marketplace Grows</b></p>
 
<p>Reports predict that education technology spending will grow to <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-report-predicts-edtech-spend-to-reach-252bn-by-2020-580765301.html">$252 billion by 2020</a>. This is a huge global market with many groups, both international and domestic, vying for the opportunity to build a profit. One of the largest consumers of these products are government-funded schools, so it comes as no surprise that the federal Department of Education (DOE) is leading the way in helping both the formation and evaluation of these companies. The DOE’s release of the Ed Tech Rapid Cycle Evaluation Coach, also known as simply The Coach, is one of the new tools they are encouraging educators to use when assessing the effectiveness of new edtech products.</p>
 
<p><b>Government in Edtech Assessment</b></p>
 
<p>The Coach helps educators make informed decisions on edtech product purchases, taking into account effectiveness. The platform is free, openly licensed, and web-based. It assists educators in developing their learning goals, designing curriculum, using evidence to assess student progress and finalize technology adoption decisions. This provides a streamlined, standards-based method for approving and evaluating education technology. It is also a great tool for education technology researchers as it helps frame research questions and offers effective investigative methodologies. </p>
 
<p><b>Piloting with the Public</b></p>
 
<p>The impetus for individuals to use The Coach is embedded in its ability to make evaluation and justification for products easier for educators. The information gathered regarding each product is neatly packaged in a way that is easy to share on the platform, allowing for crowd-based research results for each product. However, since the The Coach is still in beta, they are offering a few users the opportunity to be pilot partners in perfecting it.</p>
 
<p> When it comes to technology, many experts believe the government is usually two steps behind; however, The Coach places a government agency at the forefront of research of development. As the edtech market continues to grow, it is important that users learn which tools are actually making a difference in the classroom. Holding education entrepreneurs to higher standards could be a win for researchers, entrepreneurs, teachers, and most importantly students.</p>
