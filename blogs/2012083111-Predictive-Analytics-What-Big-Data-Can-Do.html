            I guess we all are familiar with the term <b>Analytics</b>. It seems common sense that seeing and knowing the meaning of <i>analytics</i> will most likely have a positive impact on us. In the learning sector, it is not hard to imagine  students using analytics to measure their performances; teachers could benefit from learning analytics by better adapting their instructional methods, and of course the stakeholders could make better financial decisions based on the analytics. This technique is applied everywhere, in enterprises,  government, and entertainment (ring a bell? The movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210166/">Moneyball</a>) etc. 

What I want to talk about is one of the specific analytics techniques called <b>Predictive Analytics</b>. It combines machine learning and data mining techniques to predict what will happen next, uncover subtle patterns based on big data, rather than just gather information and present the numbers in certain ways. For organizations, it helps to manage the risks and optimize decision making. Imagine that we could know when and where the factory equipment would go wrong or what types of product or customer cause disputes more often, etc. Being able to know these before they actually happen really saves the organizations some big bucks. Such technique is also being used for increasing fan experience in watching sports. <a href="http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/predictive-analytics/index.html?psrc=ca">IBM</a> and <a href="http://www.usta.com/">USTA</a> have been working on a huge dataset from US Open since 1990. The predictive analytics predicts what are the key wining/losing factors of the players, where do the momentum shift during the game, and social tags from tweets are also used to engage the audience etc. Maybe the sports gamblers should seriously do some homework now. 

<b>What do we want to predict in class, in school, in education? </b>
An example: Purdue University's <a href="http://www.itap.purdue.edu/learning/tools/signals/">Course Signals</a> application uses students' assignment submissions, and scores, etc. to predict the “success” of the course by showing red, yellow or green lights as signals. There are several other evidence of using predictive model for enhancing learning experiences, and dropout rates, etc. But there are few integrated analytics with predictive models. Big data drives an obvious trend toward analytics. Prediction is surely one of the smart techniques to add values to it. 

Side notes: 
In old days, we exchange/collect the baseball cards (or other cards) because we really like all the glorious numbers bundled with the players and own them. The numbers, the players remind us of the good time. Nowadays, technologies allow us to discover more numbers, records, and fun facts. How many of those numbers really stay with us? I suppose, without all the numbers, pie charts or bar graphs, most people will still enjoy the games. However, because of what technology is capable of, we all want to have options of being able to see the numbers, the pie charts, bar graphs, and everything. How <i>relevant</i>  are the numbers? We are all judges. Maybe soon, we'll have electronic merchandise of interactive baseball cards, fun way of exchanging e-cards, etc.
