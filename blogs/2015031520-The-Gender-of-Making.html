<p>The use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-textiles">electronic textiles</a> is an element of the increasingly popular maker movement which emphasizes creative do-it-yourself technology projects. In this study, the authors examined high school studentsâ€™ experiences making e-textile designs across three workshops that took place over the course of a school year.  One particular aspect examined was the impact of a kit called <a href="http://lilypadarduino.org/">LilyPad Arduino</a> which mounts on fabric and enables users to sew with conductive thread to create e-textiles from ordinary fabric. The study took place in an urban area where 23% of the students were African-American.</p>

<p>The researchers found that maker activities including e-textiles promoted students' sense of themselves as designers and creators of technology. Making e-textiles renders visible the basics of how computers and electronics work, and the making of e-textiles goes beyond functionality to highlight the aesthetic dimensions in e-textile design and use. The authors argue that electronic textiles collapse the divide between the intangible of coding and the tangible of the fiber arts.  For this reason, electronic textiles offer a promising way to engage young students in coding and computer science. Furthermore, activities using e-textiles help students visualize the relationship between technology and the way things work. Such activities also teach students to appreciate the beauty of well-designed technology, that is, technology that both works well and is also pleasing to the eye.</p> 

<p>The artistry of electronic textiles could attract students who are otherwise not likely to pursue computational science. Making is particularly advantageous because it is both creative and skill-intensive, that is, both an outlet of expression and important for 21st century professional success. The authors found evidence that e-textiles disrupt the gender assumptions often associated with computing. The creative component of making might counteract the "locked clubhouse" feel of computer science where girls are not allowed. As an example, the authors cite the case of an African-American freshman in the e-textile class who designs and creates a blooming electronic flower for her mother. The success of this experience inspired her to apply and transfer to a high school that focuses on computer science.</a>

<p>Maker activities, like electronic textiles or robotics, need not be stereotyped along gender lines. They could be part of an overall effort to empower students of all races and genders to engage in computing through complex and creative activities.<p>
