<b>Title:</b> What is shared?: A framework for understanding shared innovation within communities (2011)<p>
<b>Author:</b> Richard E. West
<p>

<b>Background:</b> Today we have access to ubiquitous information and unprecedented opportunities to communicate with our social networks. The combination of these trends has created a new social landscape, which demands a different understanding and approach to how people learn and work.  One outcome of our networked society is the rise in new ideas and practices that develop out of collaborative efforts. While prior research on the nature of work and learning within groups has focused on how people learned knowledge from one another in order to gain "expert status," in todayâ€™s context group learning in the professional arena places value on innovation. West aims to add insight into innovation in <a href=" http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11423-008-9107-4?LI=true#page-1 ">his article </a> by describing a model that studies shared innovation within communities. This framework, which he refers to as a community of innovation, pulls from social learning and creativity theory.  It attempts to understand how innovation evolves within a specific social structure.  

<p><b>Findings:</b> According to West, a community of innovation entails a group of interdependent individuals who work together towards a common goal. Their collective effort is driven by self-directed motivation and by the belief in the importance of their work. The individuals tend to bring diverse perspectives, distinct professional areas of expertise, and other diverse resources to the community of innovation. 
<p>
West purports that innovative learning is fostered among groups engaged in certain processes, including collaborative inquiry, group reflection, new ideas and visions that evolve out of an interdependent process of drawing from diverse perspectives, implementing new ideas, and iterative innovation through practice. Critical throughout the aforementioned process is the sharing of information and knowledge. Information from individual areas of expertise is remixed and repurposed by others and then re-shared among the group. Members of communities of innovation also tend to constantly push themselves to gain new areas of expertise, which further opens the door for additional information to be introduced into the group mix.    

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> West aims to operationalize communities of innovation by describing them as a unique kind of community. While an important start, he argues that more research is necessary to further flesh out the parameters of what exactly constitutes a community of innovation. Further developing this conceptual model will help us advance our understanding of the social structures and practices that encourage collaborative learning and that ultimately lead to the creation of innovative ideas and products. Future research should also examine the outcomes of such communities compared to other social configurations to get a better sense of their effectiveness.
