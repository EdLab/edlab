UPDATE! we have created 18 vialogues for this project, all are public & can be found by searching for hash tag: #9/11Anniversary

<b>Why Vialogues?</b>
Vialogues provides an intuitive forum for meaningful conversations around video.  As such, Angela & I have developed a series of commemorative 9/11 vialogues to help local & national high school teachers discover how vialogues can be used to create, facilitate and annotate discussions around the tenth anniversary of 9/11.  

<b>How will we Generate Interest & Awareness?</b>
To accomplish this goal we have created 3 vialogues focused on NYC before, during and after 9/11 (see below).  I have also created an in-class activity (excerpted below) that will be featured on the Vialogues Blog and provide a "way-in" for teachers to integrate these 3 Vialogues into their plans for the week of September 11th.  Also, starting 9/5 we will feature a beautiful, commemorative banner that Angela designed, on the Vialogues site, email local teachers & tweet (overseen by Jo through the Vialogues Twitter account) about these vialogues and their corresponding activity to our 150 ed-focused Twitter followers. 

<b>We Need You!</b>
To help ensure that this effort engages the most educators, please play the role of "student" and add high school-level comments and replies to my prompt questions in the vialogues listed below.  It is our hope that these vialogues will serve as models and inspire teachers to create their own vialogues for use in the classroom.   Jo has kindly offered to convert these videos from the YouTube format so that they may be used by the widest possible group of schools & teachers.  

If you have any feedback or suggestions regarding this commemorative effort please feel free to add them here!  Also, if there are any other videos that you feel capture NYC before, during & after 9/11 please share their links!

<b>In-Class Activity:</b>
9/11 In-class Vialogues Activity
Using Vialogues to facilitate discussions in the classroom around events before, during & after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks.

<b>Materials Needed</b>
Computers, headphones & access to the three vialogues in the 9/11 series.  Please Note: You can create new, private vialogues for your class from each of these existent vialogues.  Check-out <a href="https://vialogues.com/support/help/creating-vialogue/">this page</a> for help setting-up a private vialogue for your class! 

<b>Objective</b>
Students will gain greater insight into the events directly leading-up-to, during and after the terrorist attacks of 2001.  Students will use Vialogues, an asynchronous video-discussion platform developed at Teachers College, Columbia University in-class to facilitate, annotate and record student thoughts around these events. 

<b>Activity</b>
Ask students to view and add their thoughts on each of the three vialogue in turn.  Remind students that they may reply to peer comments and answer specific questions that you have created around this video. After each of the 3 vialogues has been viewed ask for students to answer the following as a class: 

-Which comments helped you to understand the videos the most? Why? 

-Did watching these videos and sharing our thoughts in writing help you to better clarify your own feelings about these events? 

-How did your ideas about these events change after watching these videos and contributing to a discussion? 

Finally, have students copy their comments from the three vialogues into a <a href="http://www.wordle.net/">Wordle word cloud</a> (see example below)
Display these visualizations in the class & have students explore the results.  Invite the school to visit your creations and help to facilitate a school-wide discussion.

<b>Closure</b>  
How did this activity affect your views of the terrorist attacks and the ramifications for our society?  What commonalities are present across all student word clouds?  What words stood-out the most?
