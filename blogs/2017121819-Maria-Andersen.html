Dr. Maria Andersen is the founder and CEO of <a href="https://coursetune.com/">Coursetune</a>, a curriculum design platform that provides unique visual and collaborative virtual learning design spaces. Andersen has spent 15 years teaching at the college level, 16 years writing curriculum, and seven years developing digital products for learning. She built iPad games to teach algebra, launched the Canvas Network MOOC platform, built adaptive learning platforms used by McGraw Hill, and worked as the Director of Learning Design for Western Governors University. She holds degrees in math, chemistry, biology, business administration, and higher education leadership. </p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Coursetune?</b><br>
<p>My educational background is in STEM (degrees in math, chemistry, and biology), business (MBA) and education (higher education leadership). The STEM fields in particular provided a strong foundation for problem solving and an ability to think logically about the architecture and interconnectedness of features in software platforms. However, the bulk of my professional experience came from years of innovating in the classroom and a digital learning environment. I wouldn’t be where I am today if I hadn’t first taught and learned side-by-side with students for so many years.</p>

<p>When I left my job as a professor, I spent time working in the LMS industry, building MOOCs, designing adaptive learning software, and then working in competency-based education closely with instructional designers and courseware providers. All of these experiences provided different perspectives on what it takes to "build" high-quality curriculum, and ultimately led to Coursetune.</p>

<p>At this point, I’ve been on many "sides" of educational technology: I’ve been a student user, an instructor user, an administrative user, a decisionmaker about technology adoption, a product manager for edtech software, and now the cofounder of an edtech software company. I think having these multiple perspectives on educational technology is unusual in the industry and it makes me more likely to empathize with the end user (whether it be student or instructor) and advocate for usable, practical, and enjoyable software.</p>

<p><b>What has been the response from individuals and institutions who have used Coursetune?</b><br>
<p>We have had an incredibly positive response from customers. For the folks who have been doing curriculum design work with software not designed for them, Coursetune is like a breath of fresh air. The first thing we always hear is about the interface: it’s unusual in that it’s built specifically for curriculum design work. Instructional designers and curriculum designers immediately gawk and wonder why we’ve built this new way of visualizing curriculum. Many tell us that we’ve managed to visualize what they’ve always had in their heads but have never been able to articulate.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>In terms of educational technology, I think we’re going to see a shift in the design of learning systems.</p>

<p>The learning systems of the last decade are all designed around time and task completion. <i>When is this due? Did you complete the tasks required?</i> They are also marketed to the institution as the buyer, with the students and teachers as hostages to that choice.</p>

<p>I think the learning systems of tomorrow will be designed around the architecture of competency and learning objectives. <i>Have you demonstrated competency on this learning objective? Have you demonstrated this competency in a repeatable manner? Have you shown progression up a scale from basic to expert mastery?</i>  If we’re lucky, these new learning systems will be interoperable and agnostic to system so that each student can decide on their own favorite learning operating system. Imagine picking your learning operating system the same way you choose a phone, and then just connecting it to your schools and learning providers.</p>

<p><b>In addition to Coursetune, what else are you working on?</b><br>
<p>Well, I can’t tell you everything we’re working on, but I keep busy. I teach a College Algebra class for Westminster College in Salt Lake City, I try to write every week on <a href="http://busynessgirl.com/">busynessgirl.com</a> about interesting research I’m reading, and I get out to several campuses to speak to faculty about active learning and digital learning design. I think that it’s vital for me to keep my finger on the pulse of the real educational landscape.</p>
