<p><a href="http://kuatostudios.com/games/hakitzu/">Hakitzu</a> is a mobile game for the iPad and iPhone that lets users build customizable robots and challenge friends while learning JavaScript. The site, aimed at middle school students, is integrated with Facebook to encourage competition among social network connections. Hakitzu is the first offering from London-based gaming company Kuato, which specializes in games that teach programming.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The game itself is well-produced, with smooth and detailed graphics. Game play is streamlined and easy to understand; new players are guided through a training program that helps them develop skills before challenging opponents. Players control their robot and attack opponents by selecting codes from an activity library and writing the code and selectors in a small programing window. When the code is finished, users press execute to see their robot complete the instructions. Game play is easy to control, even on the iPad, and coding errors including punctuation mistakes are well-marked and correctable. The game is collaborative and encourages users to play with friends or challenge strangers. The many levels, rewards, and customizations ensure that game play remains interesting even for players with coding experience.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>At this point, Hakitzu is only available for the iPad and iPhone and coding theory in the game is scanty. The game will help users become familiar with JavaScript commands and may introduce them to coding punctuation, but without theory it may be difficult for users to translate these skills into actual coding.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Web development is one of the most important emerging skills in the workplace and there should be many ways to learn this key skill. Hakitzu is doing something unique and fun for young novice coders. Unfortunately the game seems aimed at the type of students that may already have an interest in programming. The robot fighting imagery and Apple exclusivity seem likely to attract an affluent, male crowd facing few barriers to STEM education and careers. This type of lovingly-crafted coding instruction has the potential to introduce and empower unlikely developers. Kuato clearly has a talent for creating engrossing educational games so perhaps their next offering will work to introduce coding to a more diverse audience.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Hakitzu is awesome, but it isnâ€™t breaking down any barriers.</p>
