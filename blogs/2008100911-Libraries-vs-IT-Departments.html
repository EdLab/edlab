            <a href="http://chronicle.com/media/audio/v55/i07/techtherapy/">An interesting video discussion</a> from the Chronicle's <a href="http://chronicle.com/techtherapy/">TechTherapy show</a> regarding the similarities and differences between Libraries and IT Departments.  It seems like one underlying similarity is that there is a great deal of uncertainty in both areas.  Working in the middle of both areas, this would certainly seem the case.  Libraries have felt a loss of prominence once information became easily accessible and ubiquitous.  Many of these changes were ushered in by IT.  However, IT departments are beginning to feel the same thing now that IT services are becoming available from for-profit service providers (e.g., unable to compete with such outfits as Google for providing things like email- people would much rather use GMail than a university email service- like CubMail at Columbia).  My take on it is that the service providers will eventually make both libraries and IT dispensable.  I think libraries will be the first to go, but IT will follow soon thereafter.  The outside pressures (competition with service providers), combined with the internal pressures (second-class citizens within the University to begin with), will make it increasingly difficult for either area to get things done effectively.  Once this process is complete, I think this process will probably start to work its way on the instructional/research side (it already is, but in less obvious ways than with libraries & IT).  Anyways, it looks like Universities are doing to be dealing with some ugly situations in the future, especially with the prices of college educations climbing faster than other areas and the external pressure to control costs.  However, I think things will certainly slow down a bit with the economic downturn (for example, less investment money will be available to create the new outfits that will put pressure on Universities- this is <a href="http://valleywag.com/5060881/sequoia-calls-off-the-boom">highlighted by the "boom times are over" post over on Valley Wag</a>.
