<p>Started 10 years ago at <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu">MIT Media Lab</a>, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> is now the world’s largest online programming community for kids. This platform teaches kids how to code using a programming language and enables them to share their games, animations, and stories with others. Using Scratch can be compared to playing with Lego blocks: the coding bits snap together piece by piece, and there are no instructions on how to do things the right way. Instead, kids learn by experimenting; Scratch turns coding into a sandbox experience where children have limitless creative possibilities.</p>

<p>Once children create projects on Scratch, they can share them in an online community and receive feedback from others around the world. The developers of Scratch are dedicated to keeping the platform free so that people of all backgrounds can continue to learn coding together. "Our ultimate goal with Scratch is to help all children from all backgrounds to become truly fluent with new technologies," says Mitch Resnick, professor of Learning Research at MIT Media Lab. "We want to help all children be able to design, create, invent, express themselves in new technology. That’s going to be needed to become a full and active participant in tomorrow’s society." Still growing after its decade of use, Scratch seems on its way to doing just that.</p>

<p>Why do you think it’s important for children to learn how to code? How could creating an online community around Scratch help build children’s interest in coding? Join our ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/37706/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@02:04 Cinthia.Fabian:</b> If we liken programming languages to spoken language —English or Arabic or Spanish — then it can be seen as just another tool of expression (and I definitely think that the more mechanisms people have to articulate themselves, the better). As for its pertinence, learning how to code will allow people to more easily navigate and flourish in the digital era.</p>

<p><b>@02:32 Evans.Asamoah:</b> Scratch being a free programing and also world wide is a very essential aspect. This programming will provide a quality form of education to children in third world countries. Giving them a skill which they will be able to use later on in the future on a micro level and also on a macro level, contributing to the advancement of the world.</p>
