          <!-- Post Content -->

          <p>
            While I've blogged on economics-related content for other content streams, it certainly has been a while since my last economics and education post. The recent news on how publishers and software companies have ganged up to stifle innovation in online higher learning has got me thinking about what the future of open education is going to look like. 

The education industry is not a large industry but there are certainly some big names. I am specifically thinking about publishers and those who are essentially gatekeepers in the world of educational content. Even while Khan Academy and MIT seek to disrupt the education landscape, there is still plenty of rent-seeking and extraction occurring. Textbook authors and their publishers earn plenty of money each year from releasing 'new editions' of virtually the same textbook that was released twenty years ago.

This gets at the heart of the publishing dilemma as it pertains to education. The core of writing a textbook is in fact very time consuming and involves high fixed costs; the cost of updating a textbook for a new edition or producing another copy simply pales in comparison. Yet consumers rarely pay much more for the first edition of a textbook relative to the tenth. So while consumers might be underpaying for the first edition, it is doubtful that they are getting value for their money when updating the edition of their textbook. 

But Skanda, who is asking schools to update the editions of their textbooks? That's a choice they make. If they think it's worth it, they will pay the market price. 

To that I would first say that consumers do not always know what they want. Parents often complain about old textbooks to school administrations and new shiny textbooks often serve as a kind of status symbol for the school (new textbooks->school is upper-middle class->high achieving). The second point I would underscore is the inefficiency of  oligopolistic market outcomes. The textbook publishing industry is undoubtedly dominated by a few publishers that control the flow of educational content to the classroom.

So how do I suggest we solve this problem: separate the production of the fixed costs from the marginal costs as was the case with Linux. When Linus Torvalds released the Linux OS kernel to the open-source community, his one-time investment had permanent benefits that we still underestimate. He opened up core knowledge to society. Linux has obviously gone through numerous iterations, refinements, and customized tweaks. Nevertheless, each time you use/purchase a private version of Linux, you are not paying for the original work Linus Torvalds did.

Since there are so many institutions that have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo, it's obvious why content creators and providers in education are only slowly leaking educational content. Yet if we want to freely open up knowledge to the world, making almost every textbook public is necessary. The private for-profit sector certainly has a role in refining and customizing public content to the needs of specific groups. That would be far more productive for society than to create all sorts of legal and technological barriers to educational access. Consequentially, I cannot help but think that it is going to need someone generous enough to make the one time investment into opening up educational content en masse for society to reap the infinite future benefits (a Linus Torvalds of sorts).
