            <a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2016/06/IMG_2085.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-24305"><img class="alignright wp-image-24305" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2016/06/IMG_2085-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_2085" width="311" height="233" /></a>When my turn to do the Staff Picks of the Month came around, I knew right away what I wanted to focus on: speculative fiction. Or do we call it genre fiction? Sci-Fi/Fantasy? Weird-books-where-sometimes-there's-magic-and-sometimes-there's-robots-and-sometimes-both-oh-my-god-how-do-we-define-all-of-this? The books featured in this collection belong to a form of storytelling that is often incredibly difficult to pin down with a title. It's hard to define a genre that has so many variations. Editor John Joseph Adams gives it a go in his forward to "The Best American Science Fiction and Fantasy of 2015", proposing the following definition:
<blockquote>SF/F--which is sometimes referred to by the larger umbrella term "speculative fiction"--essentially comprises stories that start by asking the question <em>What if...?</em> What if one of the fundamental operating principles of the universe didn't work the way we actually think it does? What if technology existed that enabled you to upload your consciousness to a computer? What if the creatures from our myths and legends actually existed?</blockquote>
It's not a perfect definition, but in a short blog post I think it's as good as it's going to get. That "what if" is essentially what draws me to this type of literature. I'm familiar with the every day. Sometimes it's boring, and sometimes it's incredibly exciting, but it ultimately functions based on a set of principles that are known quantities. What speculative fiction does is take those known quantities and throws in a monkey wrench to muck them up. Everything that happens in a piece of speculative literature is still driven by a set of principles, but they're a set of principles the audience is not familiar with. They are forced to reckon with them, make sense of them, and understand them in order to comprehend the story. As a reader, that's as exciting as the story itself.

Some frown upon speculative fiction, especially in the world of academia, and dismiss it as "just escapism" (code for : not <em>real</em> literature). However, I don't think that "escapism" should be a bad word when we discuss and consume fiction. It's something we should embrace, because it in no way means we, the readers, are escaping into a lesser place. Instead, we just escape into a different place, and it is amongst those differences in reality and function that we find stories that ultimately reflect ourselves. Ourselves, that is, plus more robots.

<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whether we listen with aloof amusement to the dreamlike mumbo jumbo of the Congo, or read with cultivated rapture thin translations from the sonnets of the mystic Lao-tse; now and again crack the hard nutshell of an argument of Aquinas, or catch suddenly the shining meaning of a bizarre Eskimo fairy tale: it will be always the one, shapeshifting yet marvelously constant story that we find.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ideally, we would like to help our students, in Robert Heinlein's term, to "grok" the future-- to grasp it with all their senses and all their being.

<p class="p1"><em>The Wand in the Word: Conversations with Writers of Fantasy</em> ed. by Leonard Marcus
<span class="s1">PS374.F27 W36 2006</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This might surprise you: until quite recently, fantasy writers were an outcast bunch whose work was rarely prized or rewarded. More often than not, fantasy writers of the past had to defend themselves before a doubting world, to explain why it could possibly make sense for grown persons to spend years creating stories about impossible wizards, witches, dragons, and trolls.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">*I admit to cheating a little here, the first line of non-fiction doesn't always have the same punch as the first line of fiction, so I looked for a particularly good line in the book's opening.</p>
