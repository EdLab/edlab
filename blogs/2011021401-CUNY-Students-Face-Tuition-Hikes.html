          <p>
            CUNY students again have to deal with <a href="http://www1.cuny.edu/mu/forum/2010/11/22/cuny-board-approves-budget-request-and-new-tuition-schedule-linked-to-compact-funding/">tuition hikes</a>. All CUNY students face 5 percent increase in tuition and another $500 increase for students of the Hunter School of Social Work this semester. This increase comes after a 15 percent hike was imposed on students last year. The CUNY Board of Trustees have also voted for another 2 percent increase for next year's tuition but it requires the approval of the state legislature before its implemented. Since 2003, tuition has gone up a staggering 44 percent.

<p>The hikes in tuition coincides with the raise in salaries of some top CUNY officials. The Board of Trustees approved a 9 percent salary raise for Chancellor Matthew Goldstein, moving her annual salary from $540,000 to $580,000. Seven other CUNY officials are making well over 250,000 annually. Students are enraged to see these officials receiving raises whiles their educational expenses continue to rise. The latest developments started protests by students and teachers all over CUNY campuses this past semester. At a public hearing, students noted the recession cannot be used as an excuse for the tuition hikes, and that CUNY was had been a free educational institution through two world wars and the Great Depression. Other students noted the tuition hikes would further push CUNY away from its mission of being an educational institution for the working class.  Some school administrators defended the Board of Trustees stating that the increase in tuition would help in expanding the campuses and increase enrollment.</p>
