<p><a href="http://www.agnitus.com/">Agnitus</a> is a platform with a suite of programs to develop elementary skills for new learners. Phonics, reading skills, shape recognition, and number lines all come to life with interactive games for students in preschool to third grade. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The illustrators of this learning program certainly understand the elements that go into holding a toddler’s attention. With captivatingly cute characters, a variety of textured creatures (including the most adorable caterpillar in the digital world), little ones will surely be entertained for hours. The Agnitus app is broad in its selection of features, from number lines to following text with an automated voice. One of the coolest features of the app is the simple and intuitive interactions that make up the interface. The read-along feature guides kids through reading text while they slide their finger across words in the rhythm of the voice. A miniature character face moves above the text as illustrations morph above the text in the main frame in sync with the story. Agnitus also comes with a Skills Report so parents can track their child’s progress and development in focus areas. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The Agnitus world is an engaging one, and young audiences will be hooked on the charming creatures and animated environment that this app has fostered. However, the colors and sensational illustrations could be a bit distracting for new readers while they navigate through a world where many elements are moving and demanding attention. In the phonics app, the colors are vivid, a character’s face moves along with the user, and pop up characters enter the scene as the story unfolds. This could be overwhelming for preschool students and register as being too stimulating for actual processing and understanding. In contrast, the shape and color app is simple and refined; only the important elements are present on the screen and the game is much easier to follow. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>With the multitude of developmental apps that Agnitus has provided the learning world, kids are certain to find a game that speaks to them. Engaging, fun, cute, and intentionally educational, Agnitus is a distinct and dreamy learning app for newbies. This suite will definitely keep children engaged for hours. Parents and educators can hand over the iPad confident that kids are actively engaged and learning.</p>
