          <p>
            During the past couple of days (9/23-9/25), <a href="http://www.tc.columbia.edu/faculty/?facid=msc38" target="_blank">Professor Crocco</a> and I were attending <a href="http://coehd.uno.edu/postkatrina/" target="_blank">Five Years of Post-Katrina Educational Reform Conference</a> at University of New Orleans and presented our paper ( Using Multi-Media representations of Katrina and Its Aftermath to Promote Educational, first authored by professor Crocco and coauthored by Professor Natriello , Hui Soo and myself). It was a great conference with great keynote speakers and research paper sections that addressed not only local educational reform issues in New Orleans, notably the charter school movement, but their implications on the United States educational system in general. Below are some of my observations from the conference.

Brief Background of New Orleans Public Schools
<ul>
	<li>61% of the student population in New Orleans enrolled in charter schools</li>
	<li>“Orleans Parish School Board (OPSB) and the district central office were considered sufficiently corrupt that in 2004 a special FBI task force was assigned to investigate the school system” (before Katrina) and OPSB was taken over by the Recovery School District (RSD) in 2005.</li>
	<li>Public school enrollment: 2009: 38,051 (2004, 64,920)</li>
	<li>Public school enrollment by ethnicity: 2004 94% (black)</li>
	<li>Percent of public school students eligible for free or reduced lunch 2009, 82% (2004, 77%)</li>
	<li>See more in <a href="http://www.coweninstitute.com/2010-state-of-public-education-in-new-orleans-report/" target="_blank">this report</a></li>
</ul>
Ongoing Questions:
<ul>
	<li>Governance: how do we balance autonomy with the need for oversight in serving all students?</li>
	<li>Finances: how can we maximize efficient equity and accountability in school spending?</li>
	<li>How do we build a sustainable model of teacher recruitment and training?</li>
</ul>
Professor <a href="http://eps.education.wisc.edu/faculty/ladson-billings.asp" target="_blank">Gloria Ladson-Billings</a>, the president of AERA in 2005 and Kellner Family Chair in Urban Education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, framed the keynote presentation with the concepts of cartography and critical race theory. By showing various visual representations of the world (<a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://w3.impa.br/~pcezar/gis/mapproj/mapproj.gif/mercator.gif&amp;imgrefurl=http://w3.impa.br/~pcezar/gis/mapproj/mapproj.htm&amp;usg=__bYnZOyBbsOzGu6bOEvBhkMBZEi0=&amp;h=341&amp;w=540&amp;sz=17&amp;hl=en&amp;start=0&amp;sig2=UtezJpHWSmPT6eXJM3setQ&amp;zo">south-up Map</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://w3.impa.br/~pcezar/gis/mapproj/mapproj.gif/mercator.gif&amp;imgrefurl=http://w3.impa.br/~pcezar/gis/mapproj/mapproj.htm&amp;usg=__bYnZOyBbsOzGu6bOEvBhkMBZEi0=&amp;h=341&amp;w=540&amp;sz=17&amp;hl=en&amp;start=0&amp;sig2=UtezJpHWSmPT6eXJM3setQ&amp;zo">Mercator projection</a>, Peters projection, etc) she successfully communicated the nature of cartography–constructed based on the views and values of cartographers. Thus, it is important to investigate how we construct the map of New Orleans' public education system. While public school performance in New Orleans increased as measured by standardized test scores, Professor Ladson-Billings reminded us to consider other information to fully understand the current picture of NO public education: 1). RSD public schools have highest suspension rates in the nation–four times the national average with expulsion rate 10 times the national average; 2). Local communities are not invited to this urban renewal and educational reform process; 3). “Choice,” advocated by charter school movement, is an illusion for working-class and low-income family since many of them don't have resources (e.g. time) to be fully informed to make good choices for their children; 4). What do the increased scores mean, especially when compared to the performances of other states?
