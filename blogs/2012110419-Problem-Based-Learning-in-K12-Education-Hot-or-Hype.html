<b>Title:</b> Problem-based Learning in K-12 Education: Is it Effective and How Does it Achieve its Effects?
<p>
<b>Authors:</B> Clarice Wirkala  & Deanna Kuhn ( September 12, 2011)<p>


<b>Study Design:</b> 
In recent years there has been a lot of hype around problem-based learning (PBL). Roughly defined, PBL is an instructional method in which learners have to solve an open-ended problem of which they have little prior knowledge. The idea is to encourage learners to seek out the knowledge required to address the problem, so that they walk away not only with new information, but also more general problem- solving skills. PBL inverts the traditional classroom approach in which students are first presented with new concepts through a lecture and then tested on what they learned. Instead PBL starts with an open-ended problem and some guiding questions to encourage students to seek out relevant information that will help them develop a possible solution, followed by a reiterative solution-generating process. While educators are enthusiastic about this relatively new approach, not much research has been done on the effectiveness of PBL, particularly in the K-12 realm. 
<p>

In an effort to address this research gap, <a href= "http://aer.sagepub.com/content/48/5/1157.full.pdf+html"> Clarice Wirkala and Deanna Kuhn </a> went to an urban middle school and compared three groups of students who studied the same material but participated in distinct instructional methods. One group took part in a traditional lecture and discussion setup, another group of students was divided into teams and engaged in PBL, and the third worked individually and engaged in PBL. 
<p>
Because the authors were interested in long-term learning effects, they assessed the outcomes of these different teaching methods 9 weeks after instruction. To analyze their level of comprehension, students were asked to explain specific concepts that they had previously learned. They were also asked to apply the concepts to new problem scenarios in order to test how well they could integrate and apply these concepts in new contexts.  
<p>
<b>Findings:</b> Students who participated in the individual and group PBL arrangements showed "superior mastery" compared to students in the lecture and discussion group. Among those who participated in the individual and team PBL setup there was no difference in performance. 
<p>

<b>Moving Forward:</b>
<br/>
The findings of this tightly controlled study suggest that PBL offers a more engaging and effective learning approach than the more passive lecture format of teaching.  Considering that students performed the same if they were placed in a PBL team or if they worked alone, the authors concluded that social interaction is not a critical component of PBL. 

In today’s learning sphere, educators must aim to make learning more meaningful. One approach is to ensure that learners are actively engaged in the learning process. Equally as important, today’s learners need to not only obtain new information, but also to develop the capacity to problem solve across contexts.  The results of this study suggest that PBL is a teaching and learning method that addresses these needs and is worthy of further exploration.
