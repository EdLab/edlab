            So a recent <a href ="http://insidehighered.com/content/download/417008/4850399/version/1/file/9-20finaladmissionsreport.pdf"> survey</a> shows that more colleges are accepting students who are able to pay full tuition, and not rely on financial aid. Survey also says that some of these able-to-pay students on average have lower grades than other applicants. There are others types of people who have a better chance of being admitted such as minorities, athletes, veterans, international and out-of-state students. The reason international and out-of-state students are being sought out by admission is because their tuition would be higher than other applicants, while minority students, athletes, and veterans to create a more diverse learning environment.

Colleges seeking out more able-to-pay students, with no concern for their grades, shouldn't really come as a shock to anyone. This trend has been going on for a while, but it has just become so very glaringly obvious. It's no secret that schools need a lot more money to balance the books, as evident with tuition hikes every year (thankfully I graduated before the tuition really skyrocketed!). Also some schools are facing reduced funding, further fueling the hunt for students who will bring in more tuition money. So with all these students having an edge in getting accept, what happens to all the students with higher grades but less money to pay the tuition? I don't think these won't be able to get into any college because of this, but I'm just being hopeful. I'm also hoping that this will change because students will think that colleges are not looking out for their best interests, only their own.
