          <p>
            For most students, college graduation is a time of optimism and stress. They feel optimistic about all the future holds and stress about paying student loans, especially in these uncertain economic times. It is almost inevitable for students to attend college without accumulating any debt. Several education companies have taken advantage of the fact that students are desperate to receive aid to fund their education. In order to attract students, some of these for-profit education companies falsely advertise their job placement numbers. A similar <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/us/government-to-expand-program-to-forgive-student-loan-debt.html?ref=education" target = "blank">issue</a> has developed with programs of Corinthian Colleges, especially with their schools in Florida. This company is reported to have advertised a job placement rate of 100 percent. However, research indicates that this company has an actual return rate of zero percent. The Department of Education reported that it will forgive federal loan debts for thousands of students who have been enrolled in the Corinthians College system. The Department further explained that in this case students can apply for debt relief without the burden of "proving their case."
<p>
I believe drastic measures should be set aside to deal with organizations that try to deceive students and parents. Even though this company is "for-profit," it is in the best interest of students to know more about these kinds of schools.
