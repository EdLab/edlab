<p>In a journalism classroom, it is no secret that one-trick ponies are less likely to find good reporting jobs in the industry. The demand for multimedia journalism is constantly growing, and news organizations are continuing to develop stronger video production teams, more advanced infographics, and more visible social media presences. In fact, previous research has shown that an increasing number of job announcements call for candidates who can gather and report news using mobile devices. Because of this, the push to increase multimedia technology in journalism schools has increased, though acclimating students to these new developments does not come without its challenges. In order to gauge if and how mobile technology—specifically iPads—can be used to enhance journalism training, a research team from Ohio State University used a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the way students responded to iPads in the journalism classroom.</p>
 
<p>The researchers sought to determine whether iPads influenced students’ confidence in using iPads as a journalistic tool, if iPad technology influenced students’ efficiency in journalism, to what extent students used iPads in their assignments, and what advantages and disadvantages students saw in iPad technology. By using survey data, anecdotal student blogs, and interview data, they found that after introducing iPads into the journalism classroom, students developed an increased confidence in using iPads as a tool for journalism, and an increased perception of their own abilities in reporting and journalism technology. </p>
 
<p>Students reported that the iPads were more portable and had longer battery life compared to MacBooks, and they were able to perform more video and note-taking tasks through apps. However, students also stated that iPad keyboards were much harder to use than traditional keyboards, and that multitasking—especially recording and transcribing an interview at the same time—was more difficult on the iPad. Overall, students reported there was a challenging transitional period in learning to use an iPad in a journalistic context, but also that learning allowed them to work quickly and effectively when reporting news.</p>
 
<p>In order to keep up with the increasing variety of multimedia technology in the journalism industry, journalism schools will be tasked with training their students to properly use those technologies to prepare for future jobs, which will undoubtedly require them to create live video feeds for breaking news events, or transcribe an interview in transit. However, it is just as important to critically assess the technologies available, as integrating all available multimedia resources would be extraneous and costly. This type of research, which focuses on evaluating the efficacy of iPad use in journalism, will serve as a foundation for determining if and how to best integrate technology into journalism education.</p>
