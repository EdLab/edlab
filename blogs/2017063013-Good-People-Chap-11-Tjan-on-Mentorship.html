            <p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mYmIElhB0Ys/maxresdefault.jpg" style="width: 595px;" /><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">This is the Mentorship chapter. According to Tjan, we need more mentorship, more formal mentorship, and mentorship that’s more focused on goodness.</span></p><p><br /></p><p>We get a nice peak inside Tjan’s dreamy, corporate mentorship world. <i>Important People</i> befriend you and support you on your quest to do some business stuff. <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">It turns out that Important People can be nice, and even become part of your extended family. And Young People who see you as an Important Person will help you use your new computer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">He lists several different kinds of mentor categories that these nice, Important People seem to fall into (masters, co-pilots, and so on). These categories make me think that what Tjan is actually trying to talk about is all the ways people help each other that don't have to do with work, <i>per se</i>.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">That's a lot to talk about. But then he clearly wants to pinpoint the ways that advice-giving can be focused on sustaining and supporting goodness. I'm not so sure it can. Similar to my reaction to his <a href="https://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/blog/13270-Good-People-Chap-10-The-Tension-between-Grit-and-Acceptance">example cases for grit</a>, I think his focus on <i>inspirational</i> mentors does too little work and leaves us with little traction on what is at stake in mentorship.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Interestingly (for me at least), I have spent no small amount of time thinking about the intersection of inspiration and goodness. One might say I wrote my <a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/viewfile/798">dissertation</a> on it. (Getting a sense of the source of my personal vendetta here against Tjan?) For me, a more useful vantage was the idea of &quot;subordination&quot;—when we recognize that someone else is a more excellent <i>X</i> (sailor, writer, you name it) than ourselves. After recognition, the point becomes to better understand their relationship to a tradition of practice, as well as more intimate view of their personal narrative.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">I could go on.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">I will go on. We also need a stronger conception of goodness. Tjan offers an extremely broad and abstract version (i.e., one intertwined with truth, wisdom, wholeness, compassion, etc). It's a good try. The history of moral philosophy is littered with those who have toiled with the concept. I certainly won't try here. But I will say that specificity helps: What kind of behaviors do you want to help others enact? What kind of behaviors do you want feedback about?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Tjan laments that </span>mentorship<span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"> is often ad hoc and too focused on career </span>advancement<span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">  He wants the &quot;bigger picture&quot; of one's life and purpose to be part of an ongoing, more regular conversation. That is a very sweet wish.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"><br /></span></p><p>Tjan is clearly very observant, and his writing encompasses many fascinating stories and histories (personal and newsworthy). But through his viewpoint we're seeing the world from a very bright, lucky, wealthy perspective.<span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"><br /></span></p><p><br /></p><p>Is it interesting to think about how mentorship unfolds, how it can work, and how we can make it better? Sure! But Tjan’s text doesn’t help us do those things. <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">He elides most difficult parts of even traditional &quot;career advancement mentorship:&quot; personal boundaries, soured relationships, personality mis-matches, and even difficult conversations.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">I think a more sensible approach would be to discuss models of excellence. The lovely thing is that you can have these discussions with anyone (to greater and lesser extents, of course). We might ask each other, &quot;What do you like about how X works?&quot; Or &quot;Where do you think X falls short?&quot; And so on. I do think that we could take supporting these discussions more seriously as an organization, and that it could better support our personal development.</span></p><p><br /></p><p>My summary (liberties taken):</p><p><br /></p><ul><li>Tjan is smart. He puts a lot of words together. Many of the words describe his experiences doing things that only smart people get to do.</li><li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Tjan is lucky. He goes to Davos as an early-career intern and gets a job helping a dictator. Plus he's met and heard of a lot of other lucky people who happen to be mostly men.</span><br /></li><li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Tjan is wealthy. That’s his job: keep the global capital flowing. Extract it from laborers. Manage it with organizations. Use it to shore up immense inequities. Get paid a lot for your “services.” Pretend your family is another business. Write during your leisure time.</span><br /></li></ul><p><br /></p><p>Perhaps I have mistakenly chosen to be right instead of kind. Please learn from my mistakes.</p><p><br /></p><p>As a would-be Reverse Mentor to Tjan, I would let him know I find his conceptual efforts (as well as sheer volume of writing) extremely commendable. There are many smart, lucky wealthy people who would benefit greatly from taking his general premise seriously (and I hope they do!). Others may find value in his expansive knowledge and talented storytelling abilities. But I would also encourage him to follow his own advice: take your time in life as you follow your unconventional path on the way to agented-immortality, and be a better listener.</p><p><br /></p>
