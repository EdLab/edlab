          <p>
            After almost four full years of high school (very close to my graduation), one of the questions I've always had to answer in several of my high school courses is who is really American? In my literature and history courses, I've been able to learn a lot about the history and cultures of African Americans, Mexican Americans, Native Americans, Puerto Ricans, Chinese Americans, the LGBT community, and women, among others. What do all these people have in common? They all had to fight in some way to be treated as an American. For example, women didn't have the right to choose if they could get an abortion and were forced to have the child or go through back alley abortions. Women had to protest and struggle to finally have rights to an abortion, among other rights, in the United States. 

But what is being an American? Well my definition of being American is being free, having the right to choose what you want to do, say what you want, and being treated equally despite different race, gender or sexual orientation. That is my definition of being an American. What is your definition of being an American?
