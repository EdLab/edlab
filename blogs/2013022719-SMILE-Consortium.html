<i>You may be wondering just what the SMILE Plug is good for? Well, Stanford's SMILE Platform is designed to get students creating questions in the classroom instead of answering them</i>(<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/18/marvell-stanford-smile-plug-smile-consortiumcloud-computer-smile-con/">Engadget</a>).
<p>
<b>Smile! You’re on a Smartphone</b><br>
Stanford Mobile Inquiry-Based Learning Environment (SMILE) is a thirty-dollar mobile learning management system that connects a classroom of mobile devices to a mini cloud-based network.  Not only does the SMILE environment and "plug computer" help to create a more networked, safe in-class learning experience, but the system, already piloted in 20 schools world-wide, encourages mobile, inquiry-based interactions.  This goal is in line with the mission of the <a href="http://www.smileconsortium.org/about.html#">SMILE Consortium,</a> which is a member-based, open-source community dedicated to developing mobile technologies.  Additionally, the consortium whose members include many Stanford faculty is focused on, "training and induction of pedagogies that prepare students with 21st century skills and research related projects."  
<p>
The group also oversees and supports the development of the SMILE "plug computer" and is led by a board of directors and a volunteer team of executives involved in marketing and management.  The main goal of the group is eventually to distribute free SMILE software to schools around the world.  Currently, as evidenced in this <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/5259">vialogue</a>, educators at participating pilot schools in grades K-12 through graduate level are using the SMILE computer to encourage inquiry-based learning and achieve greater mobile integration in the classroom.  
<p>
The SMILE platform creates a Wi-Fi network that connects up to 60 student mobile devices.  Learners are then able both to ask and answer questions that are then "pushed" to the whole group for consideration.  One student featured in the aforementioned vialogue stated that the device and resultant mobile interaction helped him and fellow classmates to "learn more" and feel more engaged in otherwise "boring" classwork dominated by traditional student/teacher interactions.  Additionally, a participating educator cited the open platform’s ability to empower shyer students to engage and make their opinions known via a networked smartphone instead of by the traditional method of raising their hands.
<p>
<b>BYOD to the Cloud</b><br>
The BYOD trend continues to grow, with everyone from the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/digitalgov/bring-your-own-device">Federal Government</a> to <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2012/10/florida_to_become_statewide_by.html">Florida’s schools</a>, freeing-up employees and learners to bring their own "devices" (most often smartphones) to their place of work and learning.  While a valiant effort, it takes inexpensive cloud-enabled devices like SMILE to connect the dots among device, learner and curriculum.  It is one thing to allow personal technology in previously "off-limits" environments and very much another to provide the virtual bridge to support this integration.  
<p>
Stanford is piloting SMILE-powered programs in local schools such as <a href="http://sunnyvaleschool.ca.schoolwebpages.com/education/school/school.php?sectionid=42">Ellis Elementary</a>, and those involved believe that the <a href="http://www.marvell.com/solutions/education/cloud-computer-for-smile.jsp">newest version of the device</a>, which was released in October in partnership with California-based hardware manufacturer <a href="http://www.marvell.com/">Marvell</a>, will be even more useful to both learners and educators.  Assistant Dean of the Stanford School of Education, Paul Kim, wanted to take <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/01/08/marvells-classroom-3-0-initative-armada-smile-plug-computer-ces-2012/">the original model</a> introduced in January of this year to the next level.  The latest model is a more polished product than the original with more peripheral options and power.  Kim hopes to help re-imagine the traditional educational system and use the device to encourage inquiry-based learning that will empower students to find answers on their own.  Kim also explains that he hopes SMILE will help to "flip" the traditional practice of "drill & kill" and instead of mindless memorization, he proposes a classroom where students are "freely making inquiries and finding answers by themselves."  Kim also envisions a classroom in which students use smartphones to conduct research so that "Students are creating the questions by doing their own research... and integrating their own mobile media."
<p>
These ubiquitous, mobile technologies help encourage "just-in-time" research and peer-to-peer learning.  It is after-all, often more important to ask the right questions than to have the right answers memorized for a test.
