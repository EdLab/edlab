<p><a href="https://www.shadowdrawapp.com/">ShadowDraw</a> is a free app that provides interactive tutorials on how to create art in a variety of styles on an iPad with Apple Pencil. Guided by professional artists, amatures can learn to create everything from basic cartoons to realistic 3D figures.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>If you’ve ever wanted to feel a part of an artist’s process, you’ll enjoy ShadowDraw. The user watches lines emerge on the screen and traces them as they appear to replicate exactly what the professional artist has created. I really appreciate that I could see a piece of art being created independently, yet also interact with the drawing as it materialized on the page.</p>

<p>Typically, introductory art is extremely linear, based on rather boring step-by-step processes that don’t reflect the full scope of artistic creation. ShadowDraw, on the other hand, requires you to follow an artist through their personal process, meaning you sometimes move from one part of the subject to another, fixing and filling in spaces as the artist would in real life. Seeing how the artist starts, what they erase, and how they create something beautiful out of nothing really is magical.</p>

<p>For those who have always wanted to learn to draw but have little faith in their ability to pick up the skill, this app is a huge confidence builder. I have dabbled in art, but I’m certainly no professional, so the speed at which I could create something I was pleased with was thrilling. As my confidence grew, performance anxiety lowered to the point where the activity felt almost meditative.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Though ShadowDraw excels at helping individuals create exact replicas of the various illustrations offered, the user has very little freedom and no artistic license until after the lesson is completed. While this is mostly fine for the intended audience, it does pose minor problems when the user breaks slightly from expectations. Instructions will not be continued until the exact line or shape has been completed, which I sometimes found frustrating, and when you follow an artist’s move to erase original sketch lines, you may find that you have to revise a bit.</p>

<p>I think what I found most disappointing was that I didn’t feel like I received real lessons from a professional. I downloaded ShadowDraw expecting an audio component, and wished that I could hear tips and gain insight into the artist’s thought process. Anyone who wants to truly learn art has to eventually create their own work, but this app doesn’t really prepare the user for that next step.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>I really enjoyed using ShadowDraw and am impressed with its design, but it’s important to recognize the app’s limitations. For anyone interested in the artistic process of sketching or cartooning, and for those looking for a more portable version of the adult coloring book, it holds great merit. But for the true aspiring artist, its usefulness will wear out quickly.</p>
