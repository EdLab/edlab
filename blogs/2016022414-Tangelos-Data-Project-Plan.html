          <p>
            For the Data Development Seminar:

Education Social Portfolio

We wanted to create an educational portfolio or passport to match participant data with others. We could do this with the articles they are reading, the Vialogues they have posted in, the content that they are working in, the universities they are from, their educational backgrounds, etc.

We can collect data with personal interests to create other branches of social connections. These could be established in the application interface before the event and create a social context to provide for participants. (E.g. collected data on top three snacks, asking top reads of the demographic's field of interest, top 3 GIFS or mems to describe themselves)l. We would really want to personalize these to make them relevant).

Educational Problem Solving: Based on everyone's strengths and abilities, you create intersections between participants working in different fields or same fields to enhance a problem-solving activity. You could also use data based on their performances in same or different field groups.

Event Hosts: Would this information be valuable?
We would be easily able to curate future events that the participants would want to attend by curating their Learning Theater interests/attendances.

We would also propose that participants could curate their own event notifications (E.g. I only want to attend events at NYU, I am more interested in the environmental aspects of this particular event, and no longer want to receive notifications on Political events, whatever their preference).
