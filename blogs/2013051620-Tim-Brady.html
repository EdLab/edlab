<a href="http://www.imaginek12.com/about.html">Tim Brady</a>, a founder and managing partner at leading Silicon Valley-based EdTech accelerator, <a href="http://www.imaginek12.com/index.html">ImagineK12</a>, has played an instrumental role in launching and marketing one of the worldâ€™s most recognizable companies, Yahoo! Inc.   Brady applies this experience as the first employee (in addition to two founders) and Chief Product Officer at Yahoo!  to helping to grow and support the educational technology ecosystem.  The many synergies between developing a transformative way for people to interact online and learn both in and out of the classroom has the potential to greatly impact the learning landscape.  
<p>
Prior to playing a pivotal role in marketing and launching Yahoo! commercially, he was the CEO of <a href="http://www.questbridge.org/">QuestBridge</a>, an educational company focused on providing the resources (scholarships, etc.) to send talented youth from disadvantaged backgrounds to leading universities.  Brady has also worked in an engineering and marketing capacity at Motorola in Tokyo and holds an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from Stanford and an M.B.A. from Harvard.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>

<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I was educated as an electrical engineer and received a graduate degree in business administration.   More than anything, I have realized the profound affect a good education has had on my life.  That fuels my sense of purpose working in the education industry.
<p>


<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?  <br>

<b>Answer:</b> Imagine K12 combines my 15 years experience in the tech sector and my 4 years running a non-profit in the education sector.     During my four-year stint running QuestBridge, I fell in love with the education industry.   Being the father of school-aged children, I quickly realized how far behind the education industry is in technology use.   I think it was natural to want to combine my two experiences.
<p>

<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> There are a lot of smart, dedicated people in the education industry working to improve the system.  We hope that by incubating great ed tech companies, we are able to show the industry what great software looks like.   We want to contribute to the ed reform/improvement conversation by showing what is possible from a technology standpoint.   Technology is not a silver bullet, but it can help a lot.
<p>

<b>Question:</b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? <br>

<b>Answer:</b> The two biggest trends are self-paced learning and the transition to a competency-based system rather than one based on seat time.  Both will be transformational. 
<p>

<b>Question:</b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> We are trying to make the sector more attractive to great entrepreneurs by creating a great starting point for their companies.  The education industry has a reputation of being a difficult place for startups to survive.  We are trying to change that.
