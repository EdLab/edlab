<p><a href="https://tinybop.com/apps/simple-machines">Simple Machines</a> is an app developed by Tinybop as part of their <a href="https://tinybop.com/apps">Explorer’s Library</a> collection. It aims to introduce kids to complex, real-world physics in the form of distilled and fun hands-on lessons. Intended for children ages 6–8, this game costs $2.99, and features six different games that creatively teach how distance, weight, force, direction, and strength interact in different environments. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Simple Machines is functionally designed and visually engaging. What makes it stand out, aesthetically, from other games for players this young is that it goes beyond creating beautiful and colorful settings for each game. It is the attention to detail that transfixed me: periodic grumbling and snorting sounds that remain a mystery until you uncover a dragon in one game; background activity of birds and planes that become surprisingly affected by game choices; and the way in which the game accesses your device's camera to subtly reflect fragmented images of your face in the ice blocks central to one game.</p> 

<p>Another ingenious design choice is the inclusion of two different viewing modes to chose from while playing each game. In one, you see all elements as they are, while the other reveals internal activity and mathematical elements to show how the machines in the game work. The ability to go back and forth between modes, and even split the screen to see both at once, allows players a sort of physics x-ray vision for experimentation.</p>

<p>Games in Simple Machines allow for further experimentation with wheels and axles, screws, pulley systems, and wedges in creative environments. Players manipulate inclined planes in a pinball-style game, ride different types of bicycles at different speeds over different obstacles, and change pulley systems to lift objects of different weights. While there are only one-word instructions and visual cues, the games are easy to understand and require experimentation for discovery. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While I did find some of the games to be more entertaining than others, only one ("Screw") left me feeling like it had served no real purpose. However, the games become predictable over time. Once you learn the lessons Simple Machines so expertly sets out to teach, there’s very little growth or surprise afterward. If the app included the option to build machines, for example, players would have the ability to create an unending game and perhaps Simple Machines would then sustain a longer lifespan, particularly in the hands of a young player.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Simple Machines is an excellent app that opens doors into topics young children might never encounter on their own. I appreciated this game for its thoughtful design and methods, but parents may find it is best used as a short-term tool rather than a game their child will want to play for months on end.</p>
