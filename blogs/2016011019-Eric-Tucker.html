<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
I grew up farming in Iowa, but have devoted my life to reinventing urban public schools. Profound learning disabilities marked my education, and cultivated my dedication to the design of teaching and learning systems. My educational experiences have fostered my conviction regarding the importance of life-trajectory changing learning—and to this day they continue to inform my work in developing next generation school models.</p>
 
<p>Going back to early elementary grades, lectures eluded me. I was the student who inappropriately blurted out answers, but fell asleep during the monologues that somehow always managed to be lifeless and dull. Due to learning disabilities, I could not articulate consonants, or read or write clearly, until well into my elementary career. Over the years, school numbed my passion for learning. I suffered from narration sickness. The classroom was motionless, compartmentalized and predictable—while the world was full of wonder and opportunities to learn.</p>
 
<p>In sixth grade my family moved to Tsukuba, a farming village in Japan. I attended Ozone, a public elementary school where the student body and faculty was Japanese. Growing up amid the homogeneity of Iowa, I had never understood the significance of ethnicity and language. As an English-speaker, I was excluded from classroom participation because of my inability to understand the language. History lessons and science textbooks were alien. Yet, despite the culture shock and isolation, my experience abroad would later give me the insight that all students must be given the opportunity to learn, regardless of their baseline language and academic skills, or socioeconomic background. Schools must be sites of social integration and democratic potential.</p>
 
<p>Farming was an integral part of my upbringing. At age ten, I started working at Friendly Farms organic produce, where I experienced the importance of project-based learning that takes place in a supportive community. In the winter, we’d plant in greenhouses, stoking wood-stoves all night so newly germinated seeds wouldn’t freeze. Spring brought snow peas and strawberries; summer, cucumbers and peppers. Projects spanned months and demanded sustained responsibility and attention to detail. Tomatoes planted in the dead of winter bore fruit in the heat of August. Only through careful planning, diligence and collaboration with adults were these projects realized. When droughts threatened a growing season, we continued with dogged and defiant hope. For eight years, I labored alongside farmers who taught me the meaning of passion and commitment. Under their tutelage, I grew up.</p>
 
<p>Junior high proved to be a struggle with boredom amidst a forest of worksheets—being surrounded by students who were as disengaged as I was by our academic environment led me to realize the profound and often far too negative impact that schools have on young people. Schools too often merely record and transmit conventional assumptions about the potential of students. They can, however, be catalysts for unlocking potential.</p>
 
<p>Over the past two decades, I’ve had the opportunity to work inside hundreds of schools, while serving and learning from thousands of talented educators. The professional experiences I’ve been <i>blessed</i> to have helped me understand the importance of ensuring that students who demonstrate the greatest need reap the benefits provided by the most compelling school designs.</p>
 
<p>I am committed to creating opportunities for youth to acquire the competencies and dispositions they need in order to become critical and responsible citizens. I hope to provide students, parents, teachers, and educational stakeholders with the leverage to break loose from the paralyzing chains of conformity and mediocrity that currently bind our public school system.</p>    

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>Our work is focused on imagining and launching innovative schools designed to meet all students where they are, engage them deeply in inquiry and mastery, and tailor challenges in a dynamic, personal manner. The Common Core State Standards, with their fewer, clearer, and higher aspirations, possess natural strengths that have the potential to make learning and assessment more engaging, productive, and personalized for all students. We hope to create schools that provide individualized paths to progress for students, and are robust enough to involve all aspects of the operating system in efforts to recuperate and accelerate learning.</p>
 
<p>We hope our work at Brooklyn Laboratory Charter School can inspire others who are approaching school design from scratch and working to instill systematic, strategic, and thoughtful approaches. School design is defined by constraints—especially those of time, people, technology, money, and student needs. We hope that the education sector embraces the type of unconstrained, inventive thinking, research, and design work that matters most—the type of work embodied by the Opportunity by Design initiative.</p>
 
<p>We seek to ignite a dynamic culture of learning, one that re-engineers schools to be learning-based systems rather than time-based systems. The type of learning we envision emphasizes application, production, and creation, and engages students to solve real-world problems collaboratively while helping them develop the strong peer relationships they need. Student support—facilitated by systems like <a href="http://bit.ly/1P5RCrN">Cortex</a>—must be just-in-time and differentiated to leverage student assessments and enable student-driven pacing and routes to mastery.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<ol>
<li>Entrepreneurial learning: The exponential rate of digital innovation is rapidly reordering the contours of knowledge and work, and schools must prepare students to succeed in jobs and industries we can hardly imagine. Harvard’s David Weinberg argues that we are moving from a world where knowledge meant facts from books and experts to a world of ubiquitous free information. In this era, <a href="http://bit.ly/1O3VeqX">John Seely Brown</a> argues "good questions are more important than answers."
<li>Assessment for learning: Assessment for student learning that serves, informs, and enhances teaching and learning processes, as envisioned by <a href="http://bit.ly/1RQwDvH">Professor Edmund Gordon</a>, is a cornerstone of our approach. In the years ahead, schools will employ systems of embedded, continuous, and just-in-time assessments that support personalized and competency-based academic models, offering multiple student pathways for learning. Assessment will activate the professional judgment and expertise of teachers and drive instructional effectiveness. Multiple measures of student learning, generated from a variety of tools and practices, will empower students to "make the case" for mastery, rather than relying on just one type of assessment to provide a full picture of student learning. Assessment will also foster deeper learning, as the competencies and dispositions mapped by the MyWays Framework set the stage for lifelong learning.
<li>Argumentation-centered learning: Argumentation helps ensure rigor by consistently asking students to support their thinking with evidence, to subject their thinking to skepticism and counter-argument, to rise to the challenge of refuting opposing views, and to be capable of evaluating competing claims on the basis of the strength of evidence. When students make arguments about central issues within core content areas, they think more deeply and critically. When they engage with other points of view and read complex texts closely for evidence, they learn habits of critical thinking and effective communication, and they better integrate important and relevant content. <a href="http://bit.ly/1YiHcHE">Argumentation Centered Education</a> helps provide integration and cohesion across disciplines, connecting all content areas by asking students to employ argumentation skills to achieve and to demonstrate comprehension. The more technology transforms the world, the better at communicating with evidence we must become.

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<a href="http://bit.ly/1MfLAjH">Brooklyn Laboratory Charter School</a> is a public middle school located in downtown Brooklyn that opened in 2014. We’re thrilled to share that in the school’s first year, our students—a majority of whom are complex learners with learning and attention issues—have experienced an average of 3.2 years of growth in reading and 2.1 years of growth in math as assessed by Northwest Evaluation Association Measures of Academic Progress, decisively outperforming middle schools around the country.</p>
 
<p>Our next big project is the design and launch of Brooklyn Laboratory Charter High School. We aim to serve the highest-need students in Brooklyn, particularly students with special educational requirements and low income students of color, by leveraging innovative technologies and effective learning practices to eradicate the achievement gap. Preparing all students to thrive in the knowledge economy requires that we ensure each student has access to life-trajectory changing pathways. The prerequisite is transformative school design. Just as the disadvantages that hold students back are interconnected,  solutions must be integrated and holistic. Our high school aims to bring together youth development, student agency, rigor and mastery, operational excellence, effective human capital, and personalization in a manner that gets students on track toward college readiness and postsecondary success—and hopefully serves as a lighthouse for future innovative school founders.</p>
 
<p>The high school will be designed to both accelerate learning and use recuperative strategies to help underprepared students catch up. Our high school design process will seek to configure time, space, and technology to ensure that educators have the necessary resources to motivate, engage, and guide scholars towards post-secondary success.</p>
