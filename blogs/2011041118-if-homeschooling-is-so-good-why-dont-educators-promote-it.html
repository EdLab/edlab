            I attended this session in the morning but there was no internet to live blog. Before the session I had no idea what homeschooling is but by the end of the session, I came out with a good understanding of what it is and was very intrigued by the concept. The presenters were really pressing in support of homeschooling and one of their key points was that there is literally no statistical or research evidence other than rhetorical about why homeschooling does not work. I will be very interested in learning more about this and will go through the papers but If anyone know about any other good resource to learn about homeschooling please let me know.

Here are some of my notes from the session -

Dean of SUNY school of education is the chair

On average homeschool students are scoring above average

what about socialization? social emotional and psychological development

home educated students are doing better in these terms

how about adults?
they are doing good as adults too

homeschool students are not captive audience you get very less access to them

public schooling is the LAST place where people of al culture come together


All the negativity towards hoomeschooling is competely data free

People rely on the state having the final authority

pareents right
states right
children right

states decides the children rights

Who if anyone should support homeschooling?
personal conundrum-
experience as a parent
commitment as a scholar
political learnings
current profesional role

author spent time homeschooling his children until 4th grade

summary of Dr. Ray's position -
strong evidence of efficacy of HS
idealogically based antipathy to HS
Disregard of HS outcomes in an ostensibly outocome-obsessed world
shouldn't the educational research establishment embrace HS?

Questions arising from Dr. Ray's osition -
why does mainstream antipathy or indifference to HS persist, despite the accumulation of evidence?


Kuhn's view of science-
:social studies of science"
the hypothetico deductive model does not fully explain the development and persistence of scientific theories


Kuhn's "normal science"-

established theory
productive research programs
wide consensus among scientists
puzzle solving
dismissal or disregard of counterevidence
"dominant paradigm" exclude other types of data and research from consideration


Kuhn's scientific revolutions -
counterevidence accumulates
dominant theories become untenable

what is normal science in education?
schools are the primary educational agency
equality of opportunity is the primary educational aim
the state is responsible for ensuring it
the way to ensure it is to measure outcomes

why is HS research dismissed or disregarded?
methodologically suspect
outside the control of the state thus the state cannot be held responsible for outcomes
violates the premise of universal state provision

why is dominant paradigm dominant?

self-reinforcing
legal regulation
materal incentives
research opportunities and efficiencies
academic hierarchy

what will cause a crisis in the dominant paradigm?
not the efficacy of homeschooling
not the inefficacy of schools
more likely the fiscal crisis:insolvency of retirement plans, teacher layoffs, reduced enrollment in teacher ed, reduced salaries and benefits and fewer tenure lines


need for a better theory-
non-dichotomous
recognizing informal education
recognizing full range of contributing institutions
broad range of outcomes

who should support it?
under the dominant paradigm hardly anyone
