<p>Sometimes when a robot does the vacuuming it gets stuck under a cabinet or in thick carpet, necessitating a human to help out. That’s because robots are semi-autonomous. Humans on the other hand are autonomous, and while our cognitive abilities are limited we seek advice in order to improve the outcomes of our imperfect decisions while maintaining our autonomy. Advising agents are algorithms that prompt humans in need of assistance (for example they save us energy by setting the climate control in our cars), and they have been shown to enhance positive human behavior and decrease negative. Researchers have used them in a study to show how the advice they provided to a human operator, engaging in multi-robot supervision and control, led to better performance of the human–multi-robot team.</p>
 
<p>Using more than 100 humans and 10 robots, researchers tested two hypotheses, around enhancing human performance with algorithmic advice and the associated long-term benefits, in two scenarios: a warehouse operation and a search and rescue (SAR) operation. They used two settings, one simulated and one physical, to compare behaviors. In the SAR physical setting, a human operator was required to search for, rather than rescue, certain objects with the robots. The human operator remotely supervised and controlled the robots and provided assistance when a robot got stuck or disoriented. An advising agent offered advice through the human operator’s headset in voice speech, and in text.</p>
 
<p>Interestingly, in both environments operators rarely followed advice 100% of the time, and the authors recommend a deeper investigation to resolve the question of why operators accepted certain pieces of advice in a given setting but not others. Overall, the results showed that despite enduring high uncertainty and noisy signals, human operators managed to take advantage of advising agents' suggestions, and that that advising agents were able to significantly enhance the operators' performance when managing a large team of mobile robots in both the SAR and warehouse operation tasks, because they acted as a smart filter between the robots' requests and the human operator. </p>
