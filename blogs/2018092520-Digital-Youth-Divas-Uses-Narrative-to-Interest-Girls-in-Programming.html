<p>We’ve all heard the statistics: girls, especially girls of color, are underrepresented in STEM fields. Although many show skills at a young age, their interest dissipates as they grow older and become more affected by gendered stereotypes.</p>

<p>While many programs and camps fight against this problem, one is taking a new approach that involves using narratives to build interest. <a href="http://digitalyouthnetwork.org/divas/">Digital Youth Divas</a> is an after-school program created by a research team to document how middle school girls of color respond to narrative and project-based STEM curriculum.</p>

<p>The team set up after school programs at two different urban middle schools, and 17 girls participated, all of whom were either African American or Latina. The girls attended the Digital Youth Diva club for two hours each week for an entire semester. During this time, they learned engineering and computer science by completing different projects. In addition, they read custom-made, digital YA books about girls of color engaging in tech-related activities. Each session the girls attended, they got to read a new chapter of the book so that the story progressed along with their projects.</p>

<p>Because the goal of the program was to create long-term changes for these girls, the researchers had to combat deeply ingrained gendered stereotypes to help the participants see themselves fitting into tech-related fields. This is where the narrative came in. Participants finally saw stories where girls like them were rocking at engineering and computer science, and it helped fuel their interest in their own projects.</p>

<p>In addition to the narratives, Digital Youth Divas had an online platform where girls could converse at any time, as well as a mentorship program. Digital Youth Divas only recruited women of color working in the tech field as mentors, which helped the middle school girls feel like they could succeed in tech fields too.</p>

<p>In these aspects, the program was a success, and the research team is finding ways to help other groups replicate the experience by creating an online platform for mentorship, designing professional development opportunities for adult program leaders, and connecting Digital Youth Divas participants across different contexts.</p>
