<p>Created by GalleriesNow, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/artpassport/id1220878305?mt=8">ArtPassport</a> is an app that allows you to experience contemporary and modern art shows through 360-degree views from galleries around the world. ArtPassport, which is free, allows you to browse through current and archived shows uploaded to the platform, choose which one to view, and read about the particular artist and pieces featured. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>There is no denying the extensiveness of ArtPassport’s collection. With over 200 exhibitions featured with regular new additions, I was thoroughly impressed, and found the app functioned as a great way to discover artists I might not otherwise be exposed to. Every medium and style is represented, assuring that there is something for everyone. Additionally, each exhibition comes with a show description and details about the artists. Some are accompanied by close-up images of the pieces with details, and every show features a "visit" function, which allows users to view the gallery’s location, hours, and contact information. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Though I was impressed by the number of shows available on ArtPassport, I was underwhelmed by the primary selling point of this app: the 360-degree gallery views. While the app allows for a double-click zoom in, it lacks a function to move throughout the space, providing only a single vantage point that is often too far away from the artwork to view it well. I found myself going straight to the close-up photographs instead of to the panoramic gallery view, but not every show had this option. Additionally, sculpture pieces didn’t have the same effect as they would on a viewer in an in-person gallery, since the app doesn’t allow you to circle the piece to see it from all sides. </p>

<p>Beyond the design issues, I was disappointed to find that most galleries featured were European. Though there were many from New York and a couple from Seoul, the vast majority were from London or Paris, and I would have loved to see a more international representation. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>If you’re going for the 3D experience, you’re going to be disappointed, but if you’re more interested in the artwork itself, as long as the gallery has the ability to view each piece, you’ll gain something from the app. I would recommend this app only if your interest is in discovering new artists and exhibitions, or if you’re traveling in a specific gallery or artist’s location; at the end of the day, it doesn’t compare to the real gallery experience. </p>
