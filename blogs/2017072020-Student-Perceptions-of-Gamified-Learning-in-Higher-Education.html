<p>Currently in higher education, there are concerns that student engagement and motivation are declining. For this reason, instructors are experimenting with innovative ways to teach that will capture the interest of students who grew up in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/09/the-information-age-is-over-welcome-to-the-experience-age/">the experience age</a>, where social life revolves around sending short videos and pictures to others. One emerging pedagogical tool in this vein is gamification: the act of making class content into a competitive game. Before gamification can become a mature type of pedagogy, data should be collected on how students perceive its effectiveness and enjoyment.</p>
 
<p>A team of researchers tested this question in two different higher education settings: one large class of undergrad students and one small class of postgrad students. Each group incorporated a gamified learning component into its curriculum. Students were studying business, and the gamified lesson was on taxes. After the semester, the researchers interviewed the students in focus groups to collect their data on learner reactions.</p>
 
<p>Overall, they found stark differences in how the two groups perceived the gamified learning experiences. In general, the undergrads had a positive experience with the game; they felt they learned the material well, stayed motivated, and enjoyed the lesson. Conversely, the postgrad group had a negative experience with the game; they thought it detracted from their educational goals and created an uncomfortable class atmosphere.</p>
 
<p>The researchers propose a few reasons why there was such a disparity in opinion between the two groups. For one, they suggest that class size has a big impact on student experience with gamified learning. Whereas the undergrads had a larger, more anonymous class, the postgrads had a smaller class, which made it more difficult for them to compete against one another. In addition, the undergrads felt like the learning stakes were lower, so they were able to enjoy the game instead of worrying about credentials and obtaining employable skills, unlike the postgrads. Finally, while the undergrads were in general learning majors, the postgrads were in a specialist program looking to gain specific skill sets. Because of this, the undergrads could appreciate the material they learned in the game, while the postgrads seemed frustrated with its delivery.</p>
 
<p>In light of these results, the researchers suggest that the most important thing to consider before implementing gamification into curriculum is the class context. In particular, instructors should think about class size, learning stakes, and educational level. Gamification in higher education seems to work better in larger classes where the stakes are low and students are studying introductory material with broad learning goals. Students did not report positive experiences in the postgrad class, which was smaller, had higher stakes, and comprised of students with specialized learning tracks. While more studies need to be done on the subject, these findings could help instructors figure out the best times to gamify.</p>
