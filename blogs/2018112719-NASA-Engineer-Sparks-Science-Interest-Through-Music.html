<p>Dajae Williams is breaking molds one stereotype at a time. She’s black, she’s female, she’s a musician, and she’s also a manufacturing engineer at NASA’s <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov">Jet Propulsion Lab</a>. Dajae has long had an interest in science despite the difficulties she encountered in the field along the way. Frequently, she felt different from her mostly male peers. But she didn’t let that get in her way. Instead, she is not only a NASA engineer, she’s also a mentor for kids like her interested in science but not fitting the status quo.</p>

<p>In addition to mentoring, Dajae writes science-related songs to spark academic interest in children. In this vialogue, Dajae sings her own lyrics about the quadratic formula to the tune of Soulja Boy’s "Crank That." Representation matters, and inspiring children at a young age matters, and through her career and volunteer work, Dajae is improving both of these matters full speed ahead.</p>

<p>Why is it important to break the mold in engineering or other scientific fields? How could songs like this encourage students to take an interest in science or math? Answer these and more <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/45429">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:13 Rebecca Sullivan:</b> Stereotypes penetrate students' perceptions of careers and fields of study from an early age. It's important in STEM as well as in any field to break these misconceptions. Of course Soulja Boy and engineering can go together–why not? But sometimes we need someone to say that out loud to make us realize that we had been thinking of a certain scientist 'mold.'</p>

<p><b>@02:00 Melanie Hering:</b> This reminds me of an updated and complex version of Schoolhouse Rock - music can be such a great tool for breaking down concepts and are very effective as a memory tactic, but they also pull students in, especially when they're inspired by music that is already popular. This is a brilliant idea.</p>
