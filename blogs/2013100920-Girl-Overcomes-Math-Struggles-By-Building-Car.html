Even though she isn't old enough to have a license, 14-year-old Kathryn went and bought herself a $450 Pontiac Fiero. It isn't much to look at, and whether it can even drive is yet to be determined, but Kathryn has every intention to fix it up herself and drive it out of the garage when she hits 16. Although she receives guidance and mentorship throughout the process, the motivation to complete the project is hers alone. <p>

This project brings her closer to her scholastic nemesis: math. It allows Kathryn to immerse herself completely in a problem set and solve it from the inside out. When she gets stuck, she finds help for the more technical questions from other Fiero enthusiasts via online discussion forums. Kathryn wholly appreciates the learning opportunities that this project has afforded her. In fact, she feels schools should do more to support kids and their interests by providing similar interactive learning experiences. <p>

The argument for more project-based scenarios in education has been made, but perhaps the key lies in seizing the opportunity to engage studentsâ€™ interests outside of the classroom to encourage lifelong learning habits. When was the last time you lost yourself in a project? What did you take away from it?

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@01:31 JordaJean:</b> Immersing yourself in a project gives you the opportunity to learn new things... often without even realizing you are learning! <p>

<b>@02:19 yiu.mable:</b> So for this type of project-based learning, how does it work with her school? Not every school has the time, resources, and teachers to provide opportunities for students to learn through projects that interest them. Are they just supposed to do this on their own time to help with school? Not every family will have access to enough resources for projects this extensive.
