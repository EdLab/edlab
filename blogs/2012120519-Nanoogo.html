Nanoogo is a social hosting site for child artwork, writing, and photos. The system encourages creativity with a supportive community and a suite of easy upload and creation tools aimed at K-8 learners. The site emphasizes building web skills and experimenting with creating an online presence while keeping communication positive and controlled.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b>
<p>Nanoogo has a fairly active community and stokes the collaborative fire with contests, a gamified leaderboard, and a complex reward structure for site-building activities. The positive atmosphere is maintained through moderated comments and "Kudos," Nanoogo’s version of the "Like." Taking these actions in response to another user’s work or uploading your own work earns GoPoints, which can be used to unlock new tools or customize profiles and avatars. The site’s positive atmosphere is protected with moderation on a machine, crowdsource, and human level: comments are auto-checked for negative or problematic language before they post, each post is subject to flagging by any user, and it’s clear from a look around the site that parents and adult family members are active participants in the network.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b>
<p>Privacy for minors on the web is a concern, and Nanoogo takes several steps to protect its fledgling netfolk. The profiles discourage personally identifiable information with usernames and avatars. The system also flags potentially problematic submissions by auto-searching for things like names on artwork. Nanoogo urges parents to use the network as a way to teach good web habits and skills, and the community seems like a good way to introduce students to the tempo of communication and sharing online.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b>
<p>The submission process on the site is fairly open. Nanoogo provides drawing tools as well as clip art type frames, shapes, and emoticons, but it is also easy for users to upload files and photos from their computers. The system heavily encourages the use of online images for mashups and <a href="http://www.nanoogo.com/Learn/myspecialty/laugh-about-it-/795">experimental meme creation</a>. The site has the feel of a training ground for online interaction. It is teaching the particular brand of sharing popular online today, but seems like it is also teaching users to thirst for the random reward of a "Like" or retweet. Online social skills are becoming increasingly important as our first (and sometimes only) interactions as education and business go digital. It is a bit alarming to see Nanoogo’s young users modeling the most self-indulgent and performative aspects of online life, but this is becoming an essential thing to teach.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Nanoogo is hooking them early.</p>
