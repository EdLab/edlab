<p><a href="http://www.bookleveler.com/">Bookleveler</a> is a mobile tool that helps teachers evaluate and track the reading levels of books. The app was created by a company called <a href="https://www.unboundconcepts.com/">Unbound Concepts</a> and incubated in the <a href="http://www.socraticlabs.com/Welcome.html">Socratic Labs</a> inaugural class. The tool helps students and teachers find accurate recommendations, but submissions to the system also build up Unbound Concept’s massive database of book level information. Bookleveler lets teachers scan the ISBN of a book to see the traditionally-assigned level, but they can also use it to make changes to the book’s level and those changes help make the database more accurate. Unbound Concepts aims to store data on the accuracy of traditional book leveling, but also wants to encourage searchable digitization of juvenile book content with a focus on marketing and sales.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Bookleveler is able to bring together book metadata from Amazon, word count and sentence analysis, and traditional leveling systems to offer multi-faceted book recommendations. The <a href="https://www.unboundconcepts.com/meridian/">Meridian</a> leveling system that they have developed is easy to understand: books with more pictures and simple text are at the beginning of the alphabet and more complex and wordy books are at the end. As users augment data in the system, the levels should become more defined and structured. Interested educators can participate in the <a href="http://www.bookleveler.com/know-your-level/">Know Your Level</a> survey to get a feel for the system.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The content seems to focus primarily on young children’s books, from picture books and basic readers to early middle school. Bookleveler received some <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bookleveler/id488549367?ls=1&mt=8">negative reviews</a> due to limited book selection in their database, but the company seems devoted to increasing selection and incorporating data from sources like Amazon.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Teachers and librarians have long sought a measurable and accurate way to rank the content and reading level of books. Searchable digital text content has opened up new possibilities for analyzing word use and sentence structure and inspired tools like Bookleveler and <a href="http://booklamp.org/">BookLamp</a>. These tools, which incorporate both crowdsourcing and text analysis, have the potential to dramatically improve reader matching. Encouraging young readers with the right book at the right time is an important goal for literacy. Bookleveler is leveraging the power of technology to help educators make more accurate recommendations.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Bookleveler is taking book ranking to the next level.</p>
