          <p>
            In the last few months, the New York Times has been publishing an extensive array of articles, both pro and con, about MOOCs. With his typical gusto for all things global, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/opinion/sunday/friedman-revolution-hits-the-universities.html">Thomas Friedman</a> sees online education as a major game changer in his article "Revolution Hits the Universities".  

The article also fits into his "The World is Flat" argument by examining online education's potential to lift people out of poverty and make them more globally competitive in the job market. The potential to educate large swaths of people is definitely there.  Many lower income people, including those economically disadvantaged at birth, will be able to take online courses offered by prestigious Western universities.  

However, Friedman jumps the gun - While he is careful to use the word "potential", the somewhat evangelical nature of the article implies that Friedman is pretty sure that this is where the MOOC movement is going. Since this movement is in its infancy, it is not clear how these online courses and/or degrees will be perceived in the marketplace (both domestically or abroad).  The pedagogical model has not been worked out nor has an economically viable business model.

Friedman mentions a Princeton sociologist named Mitch Duneier who is gung-ho about online classes.  In his discussion with Duneier, I am reminded of Michael Sandel's enthusiasm for teaching his famous "Justice" class at Harvard online.  It seems that these all-star professors can rebuild and tweak their teaching models as time goes on. These name brand professors (along with their name brand universities) can help sell the viability and potential of online learning.

One problem that Friedman does mention is the large dropout rates.  A subsequent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/19/opinion/the-trouble-with-online-college.html">NY Times article</a> explores this phenomenon in more detail. According to the piece, attrition rates are close to 90% for some MOOCs.  Naturally, speculation about these large rates is rampant - it seems to me that this can be accounted for by some combination of lack of motivation (since they are largely free and have no compulsory powers over the student) and less-than-adequate instructional design.

The article also questions the suitability of the online forum for the less academically successful students.  Struggling students need close contact with professors to succeed and the online format obviously does not cater to this.  These types of students also need the support networks that universities and colleges offer - giving them tutorial help, improving their basic skills and helping them manage their time.

From this standpoint, the suggestion that students should demonstrate proficiency in traditional classes before being allowed to enroll in online classes makes sense - but one questions how this policy can address the needs of students who simply cannot afford any of the traditional college classes.  I am thinking particularly of the poor and middle class (adjusting for purchasing power parity) in foreign nations - the subjects of Friedman's article.  One wonders if and how students in these countries can successfully complete the demands of online classes.

Most interestingly, the article concludes that hybrid classes - which mix traditional and online forms of learning - have been successful in educating students.  Perhaps this sort of system will yield more positive results.  

I can imagine a rural village in India, where the children have internet connection and thus access to MOOCs.  A local support network of teachers and staff (from either a secondary school or local college) can provide support for struggling students.  This model may actually work at improving the education of those born into poverty and lead to local economic development.  Friedman's vision of a game-changing "flattener" may unfortunately be a bit premature.
