          <p>
            Last night, I attended Latino Voices in the Arts, a panel discussion about the influence of Latino actors and authors at the Time Warner building. Prior to the discussion, there was a 30-minute reception where the panel, organizers and attendees engaged in a brief greet and meet. Once we settled into our seats at the auditorium, the distinguished panel was introduced. Moderating the event was <a href="http://www.trinity.edu/alumni/profiles/0509_mario_bosquez.htm">Mario Bosquez</a>, former co-anchor of Good Day New York and currently an anchor for CBS News and author of Chalupa Rules: A Latino Guide to Gringolandia. Mario then introduced <a href="http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=188849">Oscar Hijuelos</a>, author of The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love, which won him a Pulitzer Prize, making him the first Hispanic to win the prestigious award. The Mambo Kings was later adopted into a feature film starring Antonio Banderas. Next came Doris Casap, Senior Vice President of Film Programming, HBO who was followed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruben_Santiago-Hudson">Ruben Santiago-Hudson</a> (whom I recognized right away at the reception as an actor from several movies including Shaft and Coming to America), an Emmy award winning actor, director and playwright. <a href="http://www.repertorio.org/education/index.php?area=sg&id=30">Carmen Rivera</a>, a playwright and OBIE award-winning author of La Gringa was next in line before <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ortiz">John Ortiz</a>, an OBIE award-winning actor and co-founder and artistic director of the LAByrinth Theater Company. 

Bosquez, in his introduction, informed the audience that Latinos encompasses many different things and comes from all different backgrounds. He is a Tejano from Texas with some Jewish blood. Hijuelos is a New Yorker born to Cuban immigrants while Casap was born in Bolivia to a Syrian father and a Bolivian mother. Santiago-Hudson was born to an African American mother and a Puerto Rican father and both Ortiz and Rivera are New Yorkers born to Puerto Rican parents. The discussion then took on a whole new agenda when the issue of rejection and criticism was raised. Santiago-Hudson, the most outspoken member of the panel, talked in great length about the works he has completed that had yet to be picked up for production by a major studio. He insisted that despite the many setbacks, he feels passionate about the projects and is currently trying to pitch a work about children with AIDS in Zimbabwe. Rivera, who gave a humorous anecdote about her first experience in Puerto Rico as a nine-year-old, noted the fights she often has with producers who give her a deadline to write a play. She mentioned the difficulties in writing a play that grabs the attention of the reader and the audience and informed the audience it took her two years to write La Gringa. Towards the end of the hour long discussion, the audience received a chance to ask questions to the panel. Since time was of the essence, the few questions asked were mainly a continuation of the discussion about rejection and been a minority in the arts. 

The event was brilliantly summarized by Santiago-Hudson when he informed an attentive audience that Latinos love, fear, argue, fight and do everything like any other American regardless of their race or heritage and those are the themes he aims for in his works; a sentiment that was echoed by the panel with many in the audience nodding in approval. Overall, an informative and engaging discussion about Latinos and their contributions to the arts.
