<p><i>"Pionear is an instrument for telling stories about the world around you. Remove the screen as an intermediary to experience. Learn about new places and rediscover where you've already been. Listen and look with your hands free and your head up." </i> (<a href="http://pionear.co/">Pionear</a>)  </p>

<p><b> Connecting People and Place   </b> <br>
Pionear wants to bring geotagged audio tours to your smartphone, and they recently presented at the <a href="http://nymediacenter.com/">Made in NY Media Center</a> about their still-in-the-works app. The idea is that Pionear would offer curated, geo-tagged collections of audio for people exploring cities, museums, and even their own neighborhoods. Their goal is to connect people with their environment in a way that enriches their sense of place. </p>

<p><b> Create and Curate </b> <br>
One of the ways Pionear differentiates itself from other sound-based streaming apps or social media platforms is that it's envisioned as more of a marketplace for audio contentâ€”where you might go to download audio tours or site-specific stories. Right now, the real work for Pionear will be finding partners to create content so potential users will have something to explore. Still, the idea is promising and the future app has the potential for interesting use cases: museum or gallery mobile experiences, walking tours, or even scavenger-hunt-like learning experiences. </p>

<p><b> Audio Augmented Reality </b> <br>
It's easy to imagine Pionear as a platform for flipped instruction. In contrast to back pocket apps like <a href="https://www.fieldtripper.com/">Field Trip</a>, Pionear has the potential to be much more than just a passive learning experience. Since getting partners to create content is such an important early step for Pionear, it would be interesting to see them move towards collaborating with educators to create a more deliberate learning. Instead of relying exclusively on businesses or other institutions to curate a collection of geo-tagged music and audio tours that would then be available for people to purchase in an app, Pionear might do well to remain open to partnerships with teachers, educational organizations, and cultural heritage institutions to develop experiences that have the potential to enhance distance learning and augment real life instruction. </p>
