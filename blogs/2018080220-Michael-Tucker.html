<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your
current work?</b><br>
<p>I’ve been making movies since I was old enough to hold a camera, so all throughout middle school and high school I was practicing filmmaking. This continued into college at UC Santa Cruz, where I majored in film production. It was here that I was first exposed to critical film theory. I learned the history of cinema and how to analyze and dissect a film, a skill that has come in very handy.</p>

<p>During college I was constantly making short films, but I also began shooting and editing video professionally. After graduating, I spent two years working for the online video series SoundWorks Collection, where I got a lot of practice editing documentary-style videos.</p>

<p>Essentially, a lifetime of loving, making, and working on films led me to develop a skill set that was perfectly suited for making video essays about film.</p>
</p>
 
<p><b>What are some aspects that make for good storytelling? </b><br>
<p>Telling a good story is really, really hard and very complex. It requires well-designed characters woven into an intelligently-designed structure that is somehow both familiar and original. But one thing that I think is critical is to always respect the audience. For me, as an audience member, I tune out when it feels like a story has become self-indulgent.</p> 

<p><b>Do you have any advice for teachers looking to incorporate your YouTube videos into the classroom?</b><br>
<p>When I’ve talked to teachers who have played my videos in classrooms, they’ve said they tend to use them to frame a lesson. They might play a video at the start of the class to get the students engaged, and then take the ideas explored in the video and apply them to whatever topic is currently being studied. In this way teachers can then build off the examples presented in the video.</p> 

<p><b>What are you currently working on and what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>I am currently working on two different videos, one that is a more traditional video essay, and another that is a kind of investigation into the complicated cultural reaction to a certain epic blockbuster released last December. I have no idea what the video will actually become in the end, but that’s where I’m starting from.</p>

<p>I’m also writing a few screenplays of my own, and am hoping to start shooting some of them sometime in the next year.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter or other social media?</b><br>
<p>In the filmmaking world, I enjoy following <a href="https://twitter.com/barryjenkins?lang=en">Barry Jenkins</a>. I really liked Moonlight (which he wrote and directed), and I was lucky enough to hear him do a Q&A last September. He was articulate, kind, and very intelligent. Those are all traits I think are really important in a filmmaker.</p>
