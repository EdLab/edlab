            Female Genital Mutilation or Female Circumcision is an ancient practice that predates the Islamic religion but is still practiced around the world. Most procedures consist of partial or complete removal of the Clitoris and sometimes the removal of labia minora as well; in rare cases, stitching the external genitalia leaving a small opening, just enough to fit a matchstick. <a href= http://www.fgmnetwork.org/intro/world.php>Prevalence rates</a> are very high in many countries and in a country like Indonesia; the Prevalence Percentage is 100%. Many Countries like the U.S. and U.K. have banned such practices on the grounds of cruelty. The <a href= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/>World Health Organization</a>  reports that, short term complications such as severe pain, shock, hemorrhage, urine retention, ulceration of the genital region and injury to adjacent tissue can occur due to such procedures. Also, these hemorrhages and infections from the procedure can lead death. The Long-Term effects of FGH include cyst formations, damage to the urethra resulting in urinary incontinence, dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse), sexual dysfunction, and difficulties with childbirth. One of the biggest and recent health risks of this procedure is the transmission of HIV. Most of the time, these procedures are done without anesthetics and with dirty equipment. There are many reasons given for practicing FGH: these include but are not limited to: psychosexual, sociological, and religious. A psychosexual reason for FGH is that, by removing the clitoris and other external parts of the genitalia, it subdues the sexual desires felt by a female and therefore helps to maintain chastity and virginity until marriage. I believe this is ridiculous, because losing virginity and chastity does not come from the external genitalia but the thoughts, ideas, and desires of the person; removing a body part will not change the urges and desires felt. Some sociological reasons given for the justification of these atrocious practices are: cultural identity, rite of passage, social integration, and maintenance of social cohesion. The latter are preposterous reasons to mutilate someone's genitalia. Societal unity can happen with simple things like national pride and agreeable minds. If a country has to perform these kinds of savage acts to create unity, then the country is lacking serious leadership. Recently, the <a href= “http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/us/AP-Britain-Female-Circumcision.html?_r=1&oref=slogin”>New York Times</a> reported that Britain is campaigning to prevent young immigrant girls to be taken back to their homeland to be mutilated. According to UNICEF estimates, about 100 to 140 million women have been subjected to genital mutilation and 3 million girls face mutilation every year. The U.S. and the United Nations should run similar campaigns to eliminate these procedures. Some might say we are practicing cultural imperialism but I say it is simple human decency.
