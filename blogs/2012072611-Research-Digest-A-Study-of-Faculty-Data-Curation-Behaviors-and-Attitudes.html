Data is a hot topic right now. Some call it the “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/15579717">data deluge</a>," and the overview of last week's Pew Internet & American Life report on <a href="http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Future-of-Big-Data.aspx">The Future of Big Data</a> says, “We swim in a sea of data … and the sea level is rising rapidly.” <a href="http://hacklibschool.wordpress.com/2012/06/08/series-emerging-careers-in-librarianship-data-curation/">Data curation</a> is an emerging LIS field, <a href="http://www.lis.illinois.edu/academics/programs/ms/data_curation">defined</a> as “the active and ongoing management of data through its lifecycle of interest and usefulness to scholarship, science, and education... [including] activities [that] enable data discovery and retrieval, maintain its quality, add value, and provide for reuse over time, and this new field includes authentication, archiving, management, preservation, retrieval, and prepresentation.” As the volume of STEM data continues growing exponentially, curating raw scientific data for long-term access is increasingly important, both for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Science">Big Science</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Science">Small Science</a>. 

<b>Summary</b>

This paper describes the reults of a survey conducted by librarians at Cal Poly on faculty behaviors and attitudes towards data curation, addressing three major areas of interest, namely, data preservation, data sharing, and eduational needs. The survey showed that faculty generally believe that they should be personally responsible for their data for the long-term, not entities such as libraries, external project partners, profesional organization, or discipinary archives. The top locations where researchers store long-term data are an external hard drive (48%), an office computer (37%), and a department of university server (28%). Obviously, if a backup copy is in the same location as the primary copy, a hardware failure or lost USB drive could lead to a devestaing loss of data. Very few respondents thought of the library as a potential source for long-term data storage services, even though there is institutional repository infrastructure in place to house data. 

Only 20% of faculty members report always, frequently, or even occasionally including data management costs in their grant applications. And while 84% researchers believe it is important to have a data preservation plan in place, fewer than 15% report always or frequently having such a plan. The survey results showed a strong desire by more than 70% of faculty who occasionally, rarely, or never educate themselves for more guidance and education on best practices for data mangaement. The authors conclude, based on the results of this study, researchers appear to need additional guidance for "creating metadata, preserving and sharing data, writing data management plans, and gaining an improved understanding of data curation practices." The authors belive that this is an unprecedented opportuntiy for librarians “to provide necessary stewardship in the data curation process.” For example, the library at Cal Poly now hosts a <a href="http://libguides.calpoly.edu/data">data curation guide </a> featuring information on the basics of data management.

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>

This is an exciting time in data curation! There are certainly implications to consider for PocketKnowledge, as EdLab considers the future of TC's digital repository. There is certainly a need for a good infrastructure to house research data, and a data curation plan. There are also bigger implications for the conversation on the future of libraries, as libraries start to become “data centers” and librarians evolve into “data scientists.” Along with the authors of this report, I believe that libraries are in a unique position to partner with researchers and provide crucial data curation resources and services. How can EdLab address these needs? We are uniquely positioned within the Gottesman Libraries to research, design, and develop revolutionary data curation services. 

On a brief side note, the librarians who authored this report used an online survey tool (Survey Monkey) to conduct their research. It made me realize that (soon!) researchers like this will commonly use Survey Sidekick and mention their methods in their report. That seems like the best kind of subtle promotion for any product.
