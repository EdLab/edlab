<p>In this study, three scholars from Temple University observe a high school English teacher’s attempt to use <a href="https://minecraft.net/">Minecraft,</a> a video game where players use cubic building blocks within the virtual landscape to survive and excel in the game’s universe, to advance his students’ comprehension of literary concepts. The study lasted for a period of six weeks. Student groups were required by their instructor to create machinima, videos within the game, which demonstrated characterization and plot.</p>

<p>The hope of the authors is that gaming will eventually become interwoven into pedagogical practices to solidify learning through familiar and enjoyable games. However, it is important to note that both instructors and students need to learn new skills in order to properly utilize video games for educational purposes. As the authors conclude, simply introducing popular games into classrooms does not immediately result in seamless learning. There is preparatory work that needs to be done, especially by teachers who must guide their students in game use. Some of the students in this study did not create machinima that met the standards of the assignment, claiming boredom and difficulty engaging with the game. Even teachers who are devoted to learning and adapting relevant technology must properly introduce and structure lessons so students are able to engage with the content.</p>

<p>Two of the student groups in this study created machinima that accurately portrayed characterization and plot, showcasing their understanding of the concepts. The authors observed that the use of Minecraft in this project offered students the advantage of being able to depict elements they may not have been able to in a live-action rather than virtual video due to cost constraints, physical incapability, and scarce availability of materials (for example, one group chose to pursue a story that involved spontaneous combustion, which was simple to do via Minecraft). Using sandbox (non-linear plot based) games in the classroom is low cost and has the potential to engage students more deeply than traditional textbook assignments as long as lessons are properly structured. This study concludes that for games to promote optimal learning, they must entertain the students in addition to educating them.</p>

<p>Introducing popular games into formal education is a feat which demands dedication and an openness on the part of administration and instructors to stretch the traditional learning paradigm. With the proper training and some experimentation inside the classroom, popular games may become widely used and highly successful as a way for students to apply concepts and for teachers to measure student comprehension of curricula. Promoting collaboration is another benefit to educational gaming, particularly in this case study. Minecraft and other popular games may just be the future of learning, and if that is the case, we may witness a generation of students becoming excited to head to school each day.</p>
