          <p>
            We are now in the middle of the first iteration of Pundit. First, thanks to everyone that for their suggestions on how to improve Pundit. For many of you who are interested in the current state of Pundit, I listed the progress we have made thus far and tasks we will be tackling in the coming weeks.

1. Pundit now has a new course information data. After exploring the Teachers College Database, we have course description, full name, department and program name. This information will serve to better match the courses to students. 

2. The search and recommendation parts of Pundit has now been revised. The recommendation course will not show the snippet, but instead it will show the top five readings in that course that best match the user profile. The search results contain two sections: the 'result' section, which shows the top five courses that contain the searching keywords in the title and description and the other is called the 'related' section, which shows the top five courses that contain the searching keywords in the readings.

3. Pundit now has several filters as it can filter courses by department and program.

4. Pundit has a new index for reading materials.

5. Several parts of code changes to reduce the response time.

6. Pundit use new DocDel API with new return value which formatted in simple-json.

The second and third functionalities have the back-end coding but lack of front-end UI design.

In the next couple of weeks, we will do the following things:

1. test new DocDel API, evaluate the performance of Pundit and tuning the parameters, hopefully they could be done by the end of this week.

2. add login function, use database to store the recommended courses to reduce the response time, hopefully mission 1, mission 2 and all other backend stuff could be done by the end of next week

3. adding 'making a wish' functionality and UI design. Hopefully, by August 1, we will have a new version of Pundit!

Thanks everyone for your support on Pundit.
