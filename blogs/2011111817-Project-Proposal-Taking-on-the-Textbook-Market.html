            ***KEEP PRIVATE***

One of the easily identifiable inefficiencies in education relates to publishing. When is a textbook sold by a private publisher proprietary content and when public content? The fact is too many textbook authors and publishers make a killing by simply re-publishing the same textbook with different pictures. Why school boards decide to buy "new" textbooks that are virtually the same as the old ones beats me but it hardly seems efficient. The value of writing textbook should be a one-time deal. Textbook authors should essentially be paid full price for the first edition, including all of the fixed costs that went into writing the first edition. The second edition onwards amount to marginal changes that do not warrant paying the same price. Yet all of this will likely remain the same as long as the big publishers remain in power.

On the other hand, if professors were paid one-time by a non-profit to write online textbooks and these online-textbooks were then made open and free, a Wikipedia-esque model could be applied to make updating content could occur in real time for little to no cost. The existing textbook authors and publishers have little reason to change their ways and stop earning free rents from the leg-work they completed years and years ago. I could also see the Linux model being applicable, where textbooks are open for everyone to manipulate and customize to their own end. Thus, paying for textbooks, and particularly the latest editions of textbooks, becomes a thing of the past.

I have more details in a project proposal for this idea as well since I think EdLab is in a prime position to move in this direction. Feedback please! I can send the project proposal to anyone interested.
