          <p>
            In 2010, the West Virginia Department of Education began <a href="http://wvde.state.wv.us/learn21/">Learn21</a>, a website that offers interactive online games for students from pre-kindergarten to twelfth grade in the following subject areas: math, science, social studies, language arts, wellness, art, music, dance, theatre, agriculture, finance, and engineering. 

<b>Pros:</b> 
Teachers can use the games in class, and students can access the website when not in school if they would like to play some more or review a subject. Learn21 offers a wide variety of subject areas for study -- the humanities are prominently featured in addition to math and science -- and the entire site is free. Some of the games are quite innovative and intriguing, even for adults: for example, "The Great Flu" in Grade 9-12 Wellness attempts to educate players about the dangers and difficulties of containing flu pandemics. 

<b>Cons:</b>   
Such a large database of games and tools requires ongoing maintenance -- I noticed that several of the links to games (e.g., "Multiple Percents" in Grade 9-12 math resources) no longer work. The games linked on Learn21 are on third party sites, and the West Virginia Department of Education claims no affiliation or association with these sites -- which means that some of these games are very well developed and supported while others are not. In addition, some of the instructional tools and videos are slow to load and do not offer assistance when it would be helpful to the user. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> 
We're looking to create an learning technology database, and it's helpful to see how other resources collect and present these resources. One difference will be that the EdLab's database will potentially include reviews from educators so that one can judge the value of a tool before devoting time to exploring it.  

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> 
It's admirable that West Virginia is trying to use computer games to teach and communicate, and that Learn21 offers such an abundance of games in a variety of subject areas.
