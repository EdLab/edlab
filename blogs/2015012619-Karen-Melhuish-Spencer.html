<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>  
<i>Ngā mihi nui kia koutou. Talofa lava. Greetings to you all.</i>
I have been lucky to work across a whole variety of different education roles, from English and Drama teaching, through to management, facilitation and consultancy. I started in schools in the UK (I’m a Yorkshire lass!); years spent in a large, secondary school in London were particularly formative. We taught students from all over the world, often from challenging backgrounds, even refugees from war zones, who brought with them many needs, strengths, stories and languages. Here in New Zealand, we have strong need to adapt the schooling system so it better reflects the needs, culture and strengths of our Māori and Pasifika students, and I have been part of an increasing push towards using <a href="http://bit.ly/1ytxVnR">Universal Design for Learning</a> to frame inclusive learning environments.
<p> 
These experiences have shaped my philosophy and vision in that I am always focused on ways in which we can design learning that positions the student in a place of agency and control over the experience. Make space for meaningful use of student voice. The rapid growth of the use of digital technologies, and my work with schools and government in this space, is increasingly motivated by the way such technologies can extend and amplify student (and educator) choice, offering multiple pathways to learning and collaboration that we can drive ourselves.
<p>
This year, I was the project lead for New Zealand’s <a href="http://bit.ly/1IqeShg">Connected Educator Month</a>, with <a href="http://bit.ly/1ziY2ws">CORE Education</a>, which drew together many of these beliefs, including that educators, too, deserve to have control and voice over their own learning.  My work in national professional learning projects for the New Zealand Ministry aligns to the same values of inclusive practice and learner independence.
<p>
<b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
I see my work as making a contribution to a much broader dialogue that is happening in the education sector at the moment. I think we are beginning to see an alignment – a tipping point, perhaps - between the digital landscape and what we know can make a real difference to education at a system level. My current projects focus on using online networks, communities, and responsive professional learning to support the New Zealand schooling sector to work together around new model for learning. For example, Connected Educator Month NZ leveraged a global calendar to draw together both grassroots groups and more formal organizations to offer a stunning array of online professional learning for educators. This kind of event acts as a catalyst for educators looking to reimagine models of networked professional learning.
<p> 
Added to this, the fluid curriculum in NZ schools allows us space to rethink how learning can be relevant, inclusive and student-focused. My colleagues and I at CORE are responding to rapid growth in educator interest around the way modern learning environments, design thinking and new pedagogies can open up the curriculum for young people. Events such as <a href="http://bit.ly/1scRp93">ULearn</a>, of which I am a part, aim to model and profile ways of working that are transformative and future-focused.
<p>
<b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
I am a contributor to <a href="http://bit.ly/12EHnXu">CORE’s Ten Trends</a> and I also worked on this year’s Horizon Report K-12. While digital technologies, connectivity and access to mobile devices are obvious technological drivers, it seems pretty clear that there is a growing call for learning that is grounded in real world issues, driven by students and teachers together. So, we are likely to see an increase in collaborative projects, makerspaces and links between schools and communities or business groups, as well as the use of immersion technologies and gaming. The shift towards more networked models of learning may well lead to new models of professional learning evolving for schools, and regions, as well as reviews of the way organizations are structured internally. For example, I see several schools in NZ shifting towards distributed leadership and flatter structures for staffing. And of course, we are seeing shifts, too, towards learner-centered pedagogies which challenge traditional modes of assessment, the structure of the school week/year and the way we use data to inform next steps. This last point is also likely to see tensions between the safe use of student information and data, and the increasing penetration of global corporations in the education sector.
<p>
<b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br> <b>Answer:</b> 
I am currently looking ahead to evolve Connected Educator Month NZ from an event to a methodology and brand that is pervasive through all CORE’s events and professional learning programmes. There is a real opportunity to champion networked ways of learning, blurring the lines between top-down and bottom-up models, so that educators across the sector can benefit from each others’ knowledge. I am also excited to be part of a CORE innovation team, using design methodology to prototype an immersive student inquiry online. Also on the boil for 2015 is an exciting national project ahead designed to support all schools to transform learning enabled by digital technologies across New Zealand.
<p>
<b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter (if you have a Twitter account)?</b><br>
The following folk have really been pushing my thinking lately around the ethics of digital technologies, how it can both enable and confine the flow of information, and blur lines of privacy and ownership. They also share great comments on the way education is evolving as new trends come to the fore.
