<p>Scientists have been able to continuously shrink down computing technology throughout the years. For instance, the smartphone you are holding has more computing power than the <a href="https://www.zmescience.com/research/technology/smartphone-power-compared-to-apollo-432/">craft</a> that reached the moon in 1969. But we are now approaching a physical limit on how small we can construct circuitry. The fix to this limitation is through quantum computing, which works on the subatomic level where physics operates differently. </p>

<p>The foundation of current computing technology is in the form of a bit, which stores data in either a 1 or a 0. All the digital innovations that we enjoy today have been built upon this binary. Now IBM has developed a method of storing data on a single atom called a qubit. The qubit, which can simultaneously be a 0 or 1, is 100,000 times more powerful compared to the traditional bit. This means that calculations and computing speeds that are unimaginable now can become a reality through this subatomic innovation.</p>
    
<p>With quantum computing, scientists think that we will be able to forecast the weather with pinpoint accuracy or detect cancer years before it strikes. What possible innovations are you excited for that could come with this technology? Add your voice to the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/41362">on Vialogues</a> </p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:44 Ryan Allen:</b> It's a confusing concept, but if this innovation can truly do the things that the video claims, then the possibilities are endless. I don't think it is even possible to fathom.</p>

<p><b>@02:14 Ruth S:</b> I have to push back a bit. I suppose quantum computing could make us more efficient and powerful as a species, but I wonder what kind of society this drive for efficiency will lead us to in the future. What happens when people reflect advancements in technology in the way they live?</p>
