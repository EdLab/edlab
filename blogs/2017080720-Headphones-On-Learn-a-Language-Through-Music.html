<p>When I was growing up, my next-door neighbor, originally from Peru, taught himself English by listening to Beatles records repeatedly. Good music, he explained to me, makes you want to learn. The new language-learning app <a href="http://www.lyriko.com/en/">Lyriko</a> was created with just this philosophy. Lyriko teaches foreign languages through song lyrics and by tasking users with various vocab-related activities as they follow along. The app is currently a semi-finalist in the <a href="http://adultliteracy.xprize.org/teams">Barbara Bush Foundation Adult Literacy XPrize Awards</a>.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Split into three difficulty tiers, Lyriko has four different activities you can tackle for each song: match the picture to the word, fill in the missing lyric, identify the misplaced words, and simply listen to the song and read the lyrics without gaining points. While the second and third activities primarily test listening and pronunciation skills, the first activity builds your foreign language vocabulary. While you read the lyrics and listen to the song, you are instructed to match highlighted words with the appropriate image displayed beneath. For me, this activity was the most fruitful.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Because Lyriko is still in its early stages, it only has three languages available to learn: English, Spanish, and Japanese. In addition, Lyriko is not designed to be a companionless language-learning app; it works much better as a supplement to courses or other learning platforms. While I could follow along with the Spanish songs and activities (having studied it in school), I was completely lost in the Japanese songs (having never learned more than a simple greeting). Perhaps I could have learned a few words here and there had I stuck with it, but there are more practical apps to start from scratch with.</p>
 
<p>In addition, while learning with good music is fun, the collection of songs on Lyriko could use some work. If they could secure more popular music on their app, repeating activities to the same songs over and over would be much more enjoyable.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Lyriko is a creative app that helps support your language learning with music and lyrics. While the current language and song choices are limited, Lyriko has plans to add more languages to the selection, and I hope that they will be able to add a few more popular songs as well.</p>
