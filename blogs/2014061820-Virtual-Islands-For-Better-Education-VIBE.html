<p><b>VIBE-rant Learning</b><br>
<a href="http://wiki.bio-se.info/doku.php">Virtual Islands for Better Education (VIBE)</a> is an interdisciplinary, avatar-based learning environment hosted on the <a href="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Main_Page">OpenSim</a> platform. VIBE is the result of collaborations between an assortment of STEM educators across a variety of disciplines and grade levels, all helmed by Ball State University science professor,  <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1402">Dr. Stephen Gasior</a></a>. VIBE allows educators to use the <a href="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Hypergrid">OpenSim hypergrid</a> to design and share lessons across a variety of topics.  As <a href="http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2013/11/3-virtual-environment-platforms-that-inspire-learning/">HyperGridBusiness explains</a>, "The overarching design methodology, is to create an immersive virtual lesson about science related subjects supported by interactive elements and object manipulation." Beyond allowing educators to craft interactive lessons covering topics ranging from archeology to genetics, VIBE offers participants the chance to freely explore thematic island land masses focused on topics ranging from The Library at Alexandria to cell mitosis. The program has drawn international interest as it allows educators to collaborate globally. However, educators may also create a private class dedicated to a single school or cohort of learners.  
<p>
<b>Virtual Learning Reimagined</b><br>
For over a decade instructors have experimented with teaching and learning on platforms such as <a href="http://secondlife.com/">SecondLife (SL)</a> (<a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/13401">here</a> are Dr. Gasior’s thoughts on teaching biology on the SL platform), but what sets VIBE apart is a singular focus on education, the opportunity to share resources freely with peers, and a move away from more commercial, monetized platforms (in this case SL). Additionally, the OpenSim environment allows VIBE participants to easily program scripts and develop resources from existent open software shared by peers on the platform. Dr. Gasior describes the benefits of moving from SL to OpenSim (read all of Dr. Gasior’s thoughts on VIBE below): "there are more and more pre-built scripts and objects that in OpenSim are more readily shareable and have an open license to modify. In addition, one can find many willing collaborators or experts for hire to help with advanced builds."  These aspects of openness, accessibility and cost-effectiveness are especially important as Dr. Gasior feels a real benefit of teaching in virtual worlds is to, "be both in more control of my teaching environment and have it scale to the needs of the class." It is this open, highly scalable approach to virtual learning that just might make VIBE the island vacation educators can’t afford NOT to take.
<p>
<b>Exclusive NLT Interview with VIBE lead, Dr. Stephen Gasior:</b><br>
<p><b>Question:</b> When, how and by whom was VIBE formed?<br>  
<b>Answer:</b> Back in summer of 2011, I had finished teaching my second Second Life class and was feeling a certain amount of discontent for that platform for delivering education classes. SL is a wonderful technology and platform for 3D visualization and socialization and artistry, but I wasn't feeling it met all the needs of a university. I think there is a reason most universities build and operate out of their own buildings, house some of their own customers, and operate as their own ISPs. I don't want to go into many of the minor frustrations as well, but as an educator I'd like to be both in more control of my teaching environment and have it scale to the needs of the class. I actually hit <a href="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Limits">prim limits</a> on my teaching island as I was having students learn chemistry. Part of that is because it was a multi-use island. At that time, the <a href="http://www.fashionresearchinstitute.com/">Fashion Research Institute</a> in conjunction with Intel was offering free regions and tech support for people looking to build projects. That created a focal point and impetus for the formation of Biological Objects for Science Education which we have now renamed as Virtual Islands for Better Education.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What technologies have made VIBE possible?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> VIBE operates its own OpenSim grids that are linked up to the wider "hypergrid" which allows for avatars to go from one hosted grid and visit another. OpenSimulator is an open-source implementation similar to Second Life that enables the creation of 3D social environments. We have been using <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox">VirtualBox by Oracle</a> running <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian Linux</a> as a way to run separate virtual machines for each grid. We currently use a Wizardry and Steamworks distribution of OpenSim and virtual machine called <a href="http://was.fm/opensim:spectacled_owl">Spectacled Owl</a>. But, in addition to the grid hosting, we use a few platforms like Facebook and Google+ for organization and marketing as well as a <a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki">DOKUWIKI</a> to promote our group and host files and tutorials. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What subjects areas does VIBE encompass? Education levels?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> VIBE activities include college level biology, post-graduate global health, science education graduate courses, 4th grade biology, and archaeology and a library for all ages. But, we are not focused on any one field or age group and are looking to help all teachers at all grade levels meet the needs of their students and their own teaching styles. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope the project will help transform the learning landscape?<br> 
<b>Answer:</b> I think 3D worlds are a great environment for visualization, role-play, student creative activities, and can help teachers transition their teaching style to e-learning more readily. But, what makes OpenSim a really special environment is that the development of rich and interactive environments is relatively cheap and feasible and amenable to do-it-yourself. <a href="http://lindenlab.com/">Linden Labs</a> built in a lot of functionality for anyone to start "building" and programming objects in Second Life which is also true for OpenSim and without their upload costs. So, I’ve really liked creating my own activities for students and there are more and more pre-built scripts and objects that in OpenSim are more readily shareable and have an open license to modify. In addition, one can find many willing collaborators or experts for hire to help with advanced builds.  I think it’s putting some of the power back in the hands of the teacher to customize their learning environment; but, in some cases, it’s something that can be done WITH the students. 
<p>
One of the great potentials of persistent virtual worlds is the ability to collaborate with fellow teachers across the globe. In essence, VIBE itself follows this creed and are happy to share our expertise with others to create a larger pool of virtual education experts. One advantage of public persistent grids, media display technologies, and the ability to archive files is that one can create repositories of knowledge (great name for a grid, right?) on teaching materials themselves or on the practice of teaching and not just for virtual world teaching. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Is VIBE most useful for distance learning, or can elements of OpenSim be supportive in-class as well?<br> 
<b>Answer:</b> OpenSim, in the way VIBE is using it, is great for having students in a regular classroom engage in an e-learning activity that is not otherwise feasible. But, we have the capability to entirely host a classroom for complete distance learning. And that latter method is something being done at several institutions. I think as more groups do both, then the platform becomes more rewarding and useful for full-time teaching filling out the majority of the syllabus with virtual activities. But, we are not there for many subjects yet. 
<p>
We are very interested in the Sim-on-a-Stick method of hosting OpenSim as a complement to persistently hosted grids. This would allow individual students to load up a virtual world on their own computers even without a network to do individual building. Then, because content can be saved in archive files and transferred to other grids (like maybe the main class grid at the school), it enables a very collaborative environment for the regular face-to-face classroom and gives students more opportunities to enjoy homework. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How would you describe an ideal VIBE interaction for learners and educators?<br> 
<b>Answer:</b> The ideal VIBE interaction is one that students recall being really engaging and something they remember. That could be because it was truly useful for understanding some knowledge concept or because they had an immersive experience in building it themselves or interacting with fellow students or the teacher. But, beyond that, I’d hate to put my ideal stamp for using VIBE or OpenSim because it’s such a rich environment, I’d hope each user finds her or her own ideal use for it. One of my favorite points of discussion from my Second Life class is that I would occasionally find students inworld teaching other students how to do the assignments and practice. Giving geographically dispersed students a place to congregate is very helpful for those that take advantage of it.
