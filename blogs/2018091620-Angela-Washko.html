<p>Angela Washko is an artist, writer, and Carnegie Mellon University professor devoted to creating new forums for discussing feminism in the spaces most hostile toward it. She has facilitated the Council on Gender Sensitivity and Behavioral Awareness in World of Warcraft since 2012, and most recently has been showcasing her video game, <a href="https://angelawashko.com/section/437138-The-Game-The-Game.html">The Game: The Game</a>, an experience that takes the form of a dating simulator, pitting the player against six men vying for their attention at a bar.</p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past experiences shape your current work, particularly when it comes to The Game: The Game?</b><br>
<p>My undergraduate degree was in fine arts with a concentration in painting from the Tyler School of Art at Temple University, and I was not really encouraged to explore my interest in gaming while I was there. It wasn’t until after school when I did my first artist residency program at the Contemporary Artists Center at Woodside that I started thinking about making artistic work that incorporated video games. While in Troy, New York I met a number of artists and cultural producers making political public performances, protest-based art, and socially engaged art. I started to think about multi-user game spaces as another type of public social space, and thought about the barriers to participation and the violent ways in which women were treated in the game I played most frequently: World of Warcraft. Applying tactics from artists working in social practice, culture jamming, and performance, I started to host public conversations in the game space with other players about the social issues embedded in the otherwise fantasy landscape.</p>

<p>After operating the Council on Gender Sensitivity and Behavioral Awareness in World of Warcraft for several years, I decided to go to grad school and attended the MFA Visual Art program at the University of California, San Diego. While enrolled in that program I started analyzing the work I was doing inside WoW. It occurred to me that many of the most aggressively anti-feminist participants in the conversations I was facilitating identified as members of the manosphere or men’s rights activists and some suggested I look into the writings of many male seduction coaches. It was then that I saw the overlap of antifeminist online organizing and the pick-up art/seduction community, which is what led me to research the community, video interview one of its most transparently misogynistic leaders, and ultimately make a game simulating their practices.</p>  

<p><b>Can you tell me a bit about your inspiration for The Game: The Game?</b><br>
<p>In developing The Game: The Game, I present the different seduction techniques of famous pick-up artists and allow those pickup artists to speak for themselves through their work and force players to interact with them in a common location for pick-up art: a bar. Players, regardless of personal gender identity, are put into the position of experiencing a common scenario that femme-presenting people experience: having their personal space invaded when it is unwelcome by men who feel entitled to it. </p> 

<p>All of the dialogue by the pick-up artists in the game is constructed from actual word-for-word advice presented in their books, websites, and DVD programs. It was important to me that I’m not just commenting on what the field is like, but rigorously showing players the actual strategies, behaviors, and language the PUAs use by having users play through them. Having these practices be an embodied experience rather than just something one reads about in a book or a newsfeed was important to me; it collapses the distance between oneself and the material and makes these often disturbing practices less abstract. The game also gives you an opportunity to slow down these practices and examine them closely, something you can’t do when you’re are experiencing them in real time in an actual bar. I think having a better understanding of the specificity of the tactics and psychology of these practices and why they are so appealing to so many men is instrumental to trying to dismantle them.</p>
<p><b>What do you hope those who interact with your work will take away from it?</b><br>
<p>I hope that people who interact with my work will take away an understanding of the different experiences that people from different identities and backgrounds have, and that the experiences of people who are marginalized or excluded from dominant groups are not only valid but important. I don’t think anyone who plays <i>The Game: The Game</i> will "learn empathy" from playing it (I think the whole empathy-games conversation is incredibly fraught), but I do think experiencing the predatory seduction techniques of pick-up artists from the perspective of a femme-presenting person can help those who are on the receiving end of those types of exchanges recognize patterns that may be helpful in future exchanges. For people who have never had that experience, perhaps they can become better allies by recognizing and calling out these types of invasive, non-consensual, and misogynistic behaviors in themselves and others.</p>
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the biggest impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>I am excited about teaching models that integrate the arts and humanities into programs in computer science and engineering. At the school where I teach we have game design in probably six different departments, but each department has a different set of values and interests. It would be nice to see more cross-collaboration between the arts and sciences in a way that doesn’t diminish the philosophical, critical, and political approaches that artists present, which often seem like an afterthought in the industry. In order to do this there has to be much more conversation across disparate fields which have developed their own unique languages and processes… but I think it’s happening!</p>
<p><b>Who is the fictional character you’d like most to be friends with?</b><br>
<p>Ed from Cowboy Bebop or Debbie from Queer as Folk (Michael’s mom).</p>
