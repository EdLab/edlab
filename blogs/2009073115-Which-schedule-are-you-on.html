            <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule</a> is an article which made the rounds extensively in my Twittersphere over the past few days. Programmers I know really seem to resonate with it. Artists do too. 

The idea here is that creative types -- including programmers -- and managers end up working on very different schedules. The author of the article, Paul Graham, suggests that as a programmer, he needs half a day at least to really get anything effective done on his code. Managers, by contrast, make their time effective by having frequent meetings. These two styles conflict when managers need to meet with makers, and the meetings interrupt makers' long-form creative work time.

How much maker or manager work do you do at EdLab? Which schedule do you find yourself on more often? Does it work well for you? 

Personally, this article resonated a lot for me. I find that I work best in roughly 1.5 hour chunks of real solid flow, with the morning giving me better focus for reading, the evenings better focus for writing, and midday/afternoon serving best for video editing, coding data, and doing administrative stuff. The article reminded me why I love EdLab -- I get to set my own schedule, with good long chunks of time both for editing video and for disappearing into the back to work on my dissertation -- and also clued me in to why I'm sometimes anxious about Wednesdays (when the seminar breaks up my day) but feel better about Mondays (when my AfterEd meeting is earlier and doesn't break up as much).
