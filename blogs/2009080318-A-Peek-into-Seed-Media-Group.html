            <b>I judged a book by its cover and found more value than I had anticipated.</b>
 
Well, it's a magazine to be exact.  This weekend, I picked up the print version of <a href=http://seedmagazine.com/>the SEED Magazine</a> in the Sci & Tech magazines shelf because of its unique cover design.  It was only after I had it in my hands that I read a line that says, “How social science can save the world from climate change.”  To some, it may sound illusive or just too general but I went on.

<img height"400" width="280" src="http://seedmagazine.com/images/uploads/preview_issue-22_0.jpg" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>

<a href=http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/the_last_experiment/>The article</a> was an interesting piece on how behavioral and social science research can help make us <u>act</u> in an environmentally conscious way as opposed to merely knowing and/or worrying about the climate changes. Other articles were also equally fascinating I wanted to buy a copy.  Then I thought what if I can get it for free? Whip out my iPhone, Google it, and then voila: I have the entire article which was published back in April - two months before it came out in print!

After some perusing, I learned that the magazine is only a small bit of a bigger endeavor. <a href=http://seedmediagroup.com/>Seed Media Group</a> also supports blogging for peer-reviewed research at <a href=http://www.researchblogging.org/>researchblogging.org</a> and experiments with 'science communication' at <a href=http://scienceblogs.com>scienceblogs.com</a>.  

<blockquote>
“<b>The best comparison for Seed</b>,” wrote a media critic, “<b>is the early years of Rolling Stone, when music was less a subject than a lens for viewing culture.</b>” Seed has received two National Magazine Award nominations, for Best Design and General Excellence, the magazine industry's highest honor, and has formed partnerships with the Museum of Modern Art and the World Economic Forum. The magazine's mission has been extended to other platforms — from software to data visualization — and markets — from Europe to Brazil.  </blockquote>

There's a lot going on in this group including a new unit that specializes in <a href=http://www.seedmediagroup.com/visualization/>data visualization</a>.
