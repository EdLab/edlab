            Check out the U.S. Department of Education's meta-analysis of over 1000 studies on online education. Rather than try to summarize the key points, here is the abstract: 

<i>A systematic search of the research literature from 1996 through July 2008 identified more than a thousand empirical studies of online learning. Analysts screened these studies to find those that (a) contrasted an online to a face-to-face condition, (b) measured student learning outcomes, (c) used a rigorous research design, and (d) provided adequate information to calculate an effect size. As a result of this screening, 51 independent effects were identified that could be subjected to meta-analysis.</i> <b>The meta-analysis found that, on average, students in online learning conditions performed better than those receiving face-to-face instruction. The difference between student outcomes for online and face-to-face classes–measured as the difference between treatment and control means, divided by the pooled standard deviation–was larger in those studies contrasting conditions that blended elements of online and face-to-face instruction with conditions taught entirely face-to-face.</b> <i>Analysts noted that these blended conditions often included additional learning time and instructional elements not received by students in control conditions. This finding suggests that the positive effects associated with blended learning should not be attributed to the media, per se. An unexpected finding was the small number of rigorous published studies contrasting online and face-to-face learning conditions for K—12 students. </i><b>In light of this small corpus, caution is required in generalizing to the K—12 population because the results are derived for the most part from studies in other settings (e.g., medical training, higher education).</b>
