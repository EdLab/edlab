<p><b>Title:</b> One Laptop per Child Birmingham: Case Study of a Radical Experiment (2012)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mark Warschauer, Shelia R. Cotton, & Morgan G. Ames</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://ijlm.net/">International Journal of Learning and Media</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> How did teachers and students in Birmingham, Alabama use OLPCâ€™s XO laptops? What was the social and technical infrastructure for OLPC program implementation in Birmingham, Alabama?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
The <a href="http://one.laptop.org/">One Laptop per Child</a> (OLPC) program aims to transform education by developing inexpensive laptops with innovative software and distributing them to low-income children around the world. The design of the OLPC program is based on its founder <a href="http://one.laptop.org/about/people/negroponte">Nicholas Negroponte</a>'s digital utopian beliefs and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert">Papert's learning theory of constructionism</a>. These beliefs position XO laptops as essential tools that facilitate student knowledge construction. Negroponte first announced the OLPC initiative in 2005. As of Oct. 2013, over 2.4 million teachers and children have received XO laptops.</p> 

<p>This study investigated one radical OLPC experiment at Birmingham, Alabama, where about 15,000 XO laptops were distributed to teachers, administrators, and students in grades 1-5. The researchers examined the use of XOs by teachers and students, and the social and technical infrastructure for OLPC program implementation. 1,202 fourth and fifth-grade students participated in pre and post-surveys. In addition, one focal school in a low-SES neighborhood that is demographically representative of the Birmingham school system was chosen for further qualitative examination including observations, interviews and artifact collection and analysis.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> Unlike other one-to-one programs in the U.S. that show frequent laptop use and positive impacts on teaching and learning activities, OLPC Birmingham program showed low levels of interest and use by teachers and schools. 80.3% of survey respondents indicated that they never used or rarely used the XO laptops. Furthermore, very limited professional development sessions were provided for teachers and very few technical supports were available for schools and children when XOs were broken. The use of the XOs does not seem to match OLPC's vision of facilitating interest-driven knowledge construction. These disappointing results could be attributed to OLPC's unrealistic faith that new technology alone could bring about educational transformation and the buggy and experimental XO laptops.</p>


<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> Rapid advances in technology have transformed the landscape of laptops and mobile devices, and one can expect that soon XO laptops might not be able to compete with other devices with a similar price tag. In fact, OLPC just released a tablet version of the XO in July 2013 to capitalize on this trend. How this latest OLPC device will fulfill its vision remains to be seen. However, the technocentric program design and its consequences in OLPC Birmingham provides a critical lesson to any new one-to-one initiatives in the U.S.: Innovative technology itself is not sufficient, and thoughtful social, technical, and pedagogical infrastructure are crucial for the success of such programs in the future.</p>
