          <p>
            I'm attending the annual College and University Faculty Assembly Conference (an affiliate group of the National Council for the Social Studies) in Washington DC today. I am presenting a research paper "Global Education through Youth Virtual Media Production" at a panel session This paper was also published in the Journal of Research in Curriculum & Instruction earlier this year. unfortunately my session was the last one and there was a strong competing session at the same time so it didn't get as many people. The session went well with fresh perspectives on practices in global citizenship education presented by scholars from international backgrounds (More details <a href="http://www.socialstudies.org/cufa2016/modules/request.php?module=oc_program&action=summary.php&id=50">here</a>). Below is the abstract of my paper in case you are interested: 

<blockquote>
New media and technology have become ubiquitous in the daily life of many young people in the U.S. and virtual worlds present new localities for youth to explore and learn about global issues and make connections with people around the world. This study investigated one youth virtual media production program Sustainability Talk as an innovative approach to global education. Findings revealed that students gained new understandings about global issues and expressed youth perspectives on sustainability through a virtual talk show. However, pedagogies that facilitate critical inquiries around global media were needed to ensure effective global learning. Designing a coherent program structure that provides more supportÂ to help youth learn digital production skills and global issues conjointly is essential for preparing young active global citizens in the mediated public space of mediapolis.
