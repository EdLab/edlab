            The 'World Wide Web Inventor', Sir Timothy Berners-Lee appeared before Congress on March 1, 2007 to discuss with the federal legislators the digital future of the World Wide Web for the United States.

During a session of the <a href="http://energycommerce.house.gov/cmte_mtgs/110-ti_hrg.030107.WorldWideWeb.shtml">House Energy and Commerce Committee</a>, Sir Berners-Lee reviewed the first decade of the Internet, its use, and commented on how "...we have only scratched the surface of what can be realized with deeper scientific investigation into its design, operation and impact on society."; concluding with the continental relationships that are working with public, private, and academic areas  to protect the systems that are in place and consider future systems.

The founder of the <a href="http://www.w3.org">World Wide Web Consortuim - W3.org</a>,  Sir Berners-Lee hoped that his comments, ideas, etc. of the big World Wide Web system that he presented to Congress would be used to build the next "thing" about the web. 

He discussed that the original vision included the universality of the web so that the consideration of  culture, language, disability, etc. of the 'user' would not matter - a universality system where everything would be linked to everything else and for everyone.

For the first 27 minutes of the clip, members of Congress outline their questions, concerns, comments, etc. of how they view the Web. Around 27:40 minutes into the video clip Sir Berners-Lee is introduced and begins his testimony on the World Wide Web then taking questions from congressional members.

This discussion is the first in a series that the House Energy and Commerce Committee will be holding in the coming months in order to determine overall decisions for the telecommunication market place and public policy development. Upcoming topics include: the digital future of the U. S., voice, video, data markets, competition, innovation, localization, and universal service.

This hearing on the Internet and the potential outcome of new policies may have significant consequences for both public and private sectors as they relate to global markets. Equally, it will be interesting to see how this may relate to research and academic institutions and how we as educators use this tool in our teaching and learning.
