<p>While <a href="https://www.lampix.co">Lampix</a> looks like a regular desk lamp, it’s actually one of this year’s biggest tech innovations. As the world’s first smart lamp, Lampix turns any surface into a smart surface, which you can then interact with as you would a computer. This smart lamp lets you work with paper documents as if they were electronic: scanning, copying and pasting, finding text within the document, and tagging specific words. It also allows individuals to work on the same document from a distance, and to sync smartphone notifications directly to the surface you’re working on.</p>

<p>Lampix shows great promise among augmented reality technologies. In fact, it won <a href="https://www.sxsw.com/awards/sxsw-accelerator/">SXSW’s 2017 accelerator event</a> in the AR/VR category. "We believe we can take the human-computer interaction to the next level," says Lampix CEO George Popescu. "We think Lampix will impact humanity as much as smartphone and desktop computers." Although I don’t know if this is true, I do know that Lampix could have a significant impact on the workplace, school, or home. Also, it proves that even the most mundane household appliances, such as a lamp, can transform into amazing smart products.</p>

<p>In what setting do you see the Lampix being the most useful? Do you agree that the Lampix will become as life changing as smartphones and desktop computers? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/36376/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:48 RuthS:</b> Lampix seems similar to this <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/3695/how-an-interactive-tabletop-will-transform-reading"target="blank">interactive tabletop created by Sony</a>. The most promising feature of the Lampix right now, I think, is that it is exciting. I'm not sure, however, if this technology is that useful. It doesn't bring anything to the table that tablets and smartphones haven't besides a new surface.</p>

<p><b>@03:04 csd2126:</b> I don't agree that Lampix will impact humanity as much as smartphones because Lampix is currently static in that it can only be used where the lamp is plugged in. At the moment it doesn't seem to extend functionality much beyond digital tools. Aside, from collaboration Lampix is similar in many ways to what computers have to offer.</p>
