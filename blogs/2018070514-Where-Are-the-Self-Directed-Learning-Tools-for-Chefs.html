            <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-size:12pt;font-family:Calibri;">For the past few years, I’ve spent summers and other chunks of free time as a cook in a small-scale, professional environment. I find the kitchen a fascinating laboratory in which to explore different aspects of learning. Every day, many moving parts collide and hopefully integrate to produce a complete, hot, delicious, and aesthetically pleasing meal at exactly the right time. The menu, the guests’ needs, the employees’ capacities, the available ingredients, the kitchen’s space and tools, the weather, and the ever-present possibility of unexpected setbacks or requests are just some of the factors constantly simmering in the kitchen, and the possibility that one or many might boil over at any time creates the stressful, demanding, and exhilarating rush that accompanies cooking.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-size:12pt;font-family:Calibri;"> </p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-size:12pt;font-family:Calibri;">No matter how well I plan my time and resources, the unexpected always seems to occur. As an amateur cook, I find my lack of experience a hindrance to dealing efficiently with little setbacks such as running out of a key ingredient or realizing halfway through that a dish won’t be ready on time. Since I’ve been reviewing educational apps recently for EdLab Review, I decided to search for a digital cooking resource that could provide me with easy conversions, substitutions, and quick fix tips in real time. Since many chefs use tablets to curate recipes and track inventory, I was confident that I would discover digital tools to facilitate on-the-ground learning and problem-solving in the kitchen. While I discovered many recipe resources such as <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/" target="_blank" style="color:rgb(149, 79, 114);text-decoration-line:underline;">Epicurious</a><span style="font-family:;" times new roman";"> and </span><a href="https://www.yummly.com/" target="_blank" style="color:rgb(149, 79, 114);text-decoration-line:underline;">Yummly</a>, and an abundance of food blogs such as <a href="https://dontwastethecrumbs.com/start-here-2/" target="_blank" style="color:rgb(149, 79, 114);text-decoration-line:underline;">Don’t Waste the Crumbs</a>, I couldn’t find any tools to help developing cooks make the real-time adjustments that I, at least, find inevitable. The recipe resources and food blogs I have come across are helpful in planning, but they don’t help me learn the technical skills that I need to become a competent professional in a time-sensitive environment. And as cute as personal stories about food are, it can be frustrating to have to scroll through pages of narrative and pictures documenting a stranger’s 8-year old son’s birthday party just to get to a recipe of chocolate chip cookies. Would it be possible to create a self-directed learning tool that cooks could use to respond to practical, immediate issues? Or would that kind of adaptable model be too difficult to implement?</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-size:12pt;font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-family:;" times new roman";"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-size:12pt;font-family:Calibri;">Food blogs and creative recipe resources, while enjoyable and helpful, sometimes make the kitchen seem like stage. Cooking appears as a hobby or a mode of self-expression, in which cooks experiment, create, and take beautiful photos of their food before sitting down to write about and share the whole experience. I appreciate these resources and the joy of cooking they communicate, but they don’t address all the needs of the cook working under time pressure to put a meal on the table in an environment in which failure is not an option. In addition to being fun, cooking can be and often is a professional activity that involves many layers of technique and skill. I hope that the very near future sees the development of digital technologies to help developing cooks hone the skills they need to respond quickly to setbacks and to overcome challenges in a professional way.</p><p style="font-size:14px;"></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-size:12pt;font-family:Calibri;"> </p>
