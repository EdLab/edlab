          <p>
            Ten years from now, when a scholar lifts her digital pen from the page, where will her article go? There are more than a few possibilities (an academic journal, a vanity site, a digital repository), but a particularly perplexing possibility spans some of these categories: it may go up for sale.

Consider the following quote from a recent <a href="http://www.fool.com/news/mft/2006/mft06062222.htm?source=eptyholnk303100&logvisit=y&npu=y&bounce=y&bounce2=y">article</a>:

<blockquote>At any rate, I was impressed with Digital Locker's evolution into Your Media Library. (A few months ago I posed the idea that the Digital Locker might be Amazon's secret weapon.) Not only can you pick up digital content there (I purchased a digital article, which was available within seconds), but you can also view all your historical purchases through Amazon and rate them, tag them, review them, and otherwise log your experience.</blockquote>

Let's return to our scholar…<!--break-->

Sure, there may be a way to get her content for free–for a while–but given the cost of supporting academic work (think: rising tuition costs, healthcare and benefits for full-time employees, and IT costs), it's not unreasonable that someone will put a price on it.

So, what is a fair price to pay at a tollbooth on a digital library?

This is a disturbing thought for many academically minded folks, but is it really unjust? A great tension lies in the apparent "free" nature of information on the web, and the actual cost of content production. One might presume something will have to give way.

The cost of the production of scholarship falls between two extremes: the "expensive" and the "inexpensive.â€? Whether or not we can always discern a difference in quality, let's assume for now that expensive scholarship is actually better. People who want it acknowledge that it's worth paying for, and that's more or less the world we find ourselves in today as “generalâ€? readers–you want the bestseller? Buy it.

But in the academic world, it is the role of universities to make “knowledgeâ€? accessible for a community of scholars. There is a complex set of commitments here (such as many universities' non-profit status), and the thing to take away from acknowledging this point is probably to recognize that universities need not be endlessly beneficent. There exists a greater community to which the university, by virtue of its commitments, need not respond. Or at least, it used to be clear that this was the case…

Now the internet has blown away some barriers to knowledge which, while once closely related to budgets that balanced diverse production costs at the university, now appear more or less arbitrary. Universities, it seems, could give the world (most of it) access to all the products of their research–and in increasingly salient and rich ways (think: data capture within the laboratory).

Can universities really afford to give knowledge away?

Universities do not exist in a landscape free of competition. Research is, and will continue to be related to the productive activities of actual people. And people are expensive–even more expensive when the really good ones distinguish your university in a marketplace of competitors for grants, students, alumni donations, etc. So here is the crux of the problem: the internet essentially makes access to information free, but this cannot be confused with making the information itself free. Disappointing? Yes. But you beg to differ: Why can't universities cover their costs with other services? –Education perhaps?

Pick your poison: will wealthy people be privy to knowledge before or after it's been wrapped in a bow? Either the cost of education is offset by research, or vice versa. (There are of course other lines of revenue such as grants or gifts, but that's another story.) The university can't have it both ways, so they try cost cutting on both sides of the fence. After all, the folks in charge don't really have a choice: you have to look like a university to get money to fund your research, and you have to have research to look like a university. Liberal arts colleges aren't so different.

Meanwhile… everyone caught in the middle goes online. Professors create e-journals, students plagiarize off the web, and pretty soon there is a glut of crap information coming up on your Google search. The world of knowledge starts to look like an anti-realist's fantasy gone wild. Before you knew what happened, the authority of academic research was shot through with holes.

Relax. This is the “marketplace of ideas.â€? Sure, it's not easy to figure out who you are anymore, or what you should do with your life, but the principles of science tell you that everything will work out OK in the end. Truth will be arrived at through Corroboration. The evidence will build up. People will stop driving excessively large cars and wars will end; you just can't let the messiness of democratic life get you down. –This is what you must believe.

But what, for example, are the necessary conditions for corroboration to take place?

1) People have to have access to information.
2) People have to be educated to arrive at productive agreements about what it means (think: scientific paradigms).

There are more conditions to be sure (and keep in mind these conditions have nothing to with corroboration making a difference), but before we return to the question of balance–arriving at the cost of knowledge–there are a few more issues to think over.

Popular content on the web has a way of proliferating, but there is also the additional matter that the archival/access assurances that traditionally accompany the publication of academic materials do not automatically translate onto the web. In a traditional library, at least I know (I hope) that money wasn't wasted on absolute trash, but this economy doesn't exist in many places on the web.

So, when it comes to my information, what qualities am I willing to pay for?

The trend, so far as I can tell, is toward complexity, diversity, and difference–it's hard to know many things about the status of the materials I may want and need, and I can rest assured there will be both expensive and inexpensive scholarship at hand that may fill my needs. It is just a matter of aligning quality with efficiency and purpose.

When horses gave way to automobiles as the vehicle of mass-transit, one might have assumed that horses would not be found in the city–roads were paved, waterholes were scarce, etc–and save for a few exceptions, they'd be right. But there are other sides to this analogy. Before there was car racing, there was horse racing. I bet it took a cool head to be a racetrack owner with a love for horses in the early twentieth century. All your buddies were telling you how the future was in automobiles! But no, the horse-lover might have insisted, there will still be horseracing...

Obviously not all horse-lovers kept their jobs, but the outcome is one more piece of evidence that the world will not be fully understood with (or filtered by) a “rationalâ€? model. And rare is the moment when our ideals align with those parts of the world that are fully "rationalized." The horse-automobile analogy is only “clearâ€? when one frames it within a context where the revolution was extreme. (Carl Sagan made quite a different use of the analogy about the evolving modes of transportation in New York City in Cosmos when he described a clear contrast between the way new modes of transportation came with sweeping changes, whereas cognitive change functions as if horses, cars, and trains simultaneously ran through the same corridors–the reptilian part of our brain both meshes with and is out of sync with our frontal lobe. Or something like that.)

In other words, place your bets, but bet on something your ideal customers want.

Will expensive scholarship eventually give way to the inexpensive variety? It depends if it's connected to the ideas people care about, as well as their processes of scientific inquiry. If people can't tell the difference, they won't pay. If people can get by without the expensive kind, they won't pay. But where it has value of varying degrees, people should be willing to pay varying amounts to access it. Sound familiar Amazon shopper?

My guess is that despite the surrounding chaos, the traditional way of exchanging academic knowledge (e.g., expensive books and journals) will be recreated on the web–it will be a marketplace that privileges (and shelters) authority. But it will not be without its new intricacies and innovations. I can imagine, for example, that the most reliable way for students to gain access to “importantâ€? knowledge is for universities to put a gate at the front of the library. Any material could come at a cost. 15 cents? $1? $20? It depends how much it's really worth as educative material… How else, as a student, would I be assured that I'm reading anything of lasting value?

So (so, so, so) what will be the role of the library in the future?
