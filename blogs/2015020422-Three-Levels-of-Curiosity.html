In some cultures, majority of people tend to be more scientific than others. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a> scientific is not just about being scientists. It's a "difference between seeing a piece of rock and the truth (of the universe) inside it." Science doesn't discriminate. It doesn't care about seniority and bureaucracy. If it's provable and reproducible, it is. I'd like to tell you about the three levels of curiosity – Superficial, Factual and Disruptive–and why I think they contribute greatly to the success and impediment in any one person, organization or nation.

<b>Superficial</b>
At this level, people simply consume what is handed to them. They read something in the news, on a blog or social networks like Facebook and they immediately take it as it is and often share it without much thought. This can be downright dangerous. When information is taken and shared without weighing in today's interconnected world, it can become viral and generatively grow into truth. This level of curiosity (or lack thereof) is often witnessed in underdeveloped or developing countries where the people are susceptible to media control, propaganda and advertisements from authorities and highly influential private entities. People with this level of curiosity hardly stop to question information, and can hardly distinguish facts from fabrications.

Sometimes, general concentration of this level of curiosity can be a result of prolonged moral judgment and fear of punishment. A good example is in some totalitarian cultures where the leading figure manipulate information (and often education) and enforce brutal prosecutions or mass sanctions on curious minds.

<b>Factual</b>
This is the average level of curiosity. People at this level do not take information as it is on the spot, but pause to identify the legitimacy of the source or seek different comparisons. Legitimacy of the source of information often plays a bigger role in the consumption of factual believers. For instance, news given out directly from distinct entities like the government or Apple will likely be relatively credible in the minds of factual believers since these entities will have to endure high consequences for fabrication of information. In developed cultures, this level of curiosity is often a bottom line. Factual believers often double-check what they have received by googling different sources for comparisons or wikiing what they have learned before letting it sink in and eventually sharing it.

Organizations with this average level of curiosity often perform better. An ideal ecosystem for this type of believers must be built around trust, strong encouragement in scientific-thinking and fair competition, empowerment, democracy, low bureaucracy and seniority and most importantly deep faith in the rules, laws or constitution.

<b>Disruptive</b>
Few people have this level of curiosity, since it is often difficult to go against the mass. Disruptors do not just believe in facts, but they often reject and attempt to debunk them. If you do not stop at Wikipedia or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica">Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</a>, you're likely a member of this group.

World's greatest change agents such as Galileo, Newton, Einstein, Tesla, Van Gogh, Hawking and Steve Jobs are often disruptive (non) believers. Most of these people often endure hardships in their lives and suffer social rejection. Only a few who have managed to actually make real disruptions are exceptionally accepted.

Note that in some edge cases, highly influential disruptors can also become threats to advancement and morality. Adolf Hitler, for instance, managed to make his disruptive political belief mainstream and inflicted a major wound in human history. Chairman Mao Zedong of China caused more than 20 million Chinese people to starve to death with the implementation of his disruptive misjudgment.

<b>Managing Curiosity</b>
Most of the time, we shuffle between these levels under different circumstances. We are in the midst of an information overload, and it is impossible and catastrophic to stick to only one level for every piece of information at hand. How one prioritizes information and allocates the right level of attention and curiosity to that information often indicates how productive he or she is in today's Information Age.
