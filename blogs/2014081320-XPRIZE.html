<p><i>The Learning Prize Group envisions a future with unprecedented, individually-tailored opportunities for lifelong learning, literacy, autonomy, and career readiness, as well as widespread tools for uplifting entire populations from the vicious cycle of poverty. We aim to empower a universally-educated population, with equal access to information and knowledge regardless of age, gender, race, nationality, or socio-economic status. </i> (From <a href="http://www.xprize.org/prize-development/learning">XPRIZE</a> site) </p>

<p><b>Imagining the Unimagined</b>
For almost two decades the <a href="http://www.xprize.org/">XPRIZE organization</a> has helped push forward and reward innovative new ideas that have the potential to positively impact humanity. Described as an "innovation engine, facilitator of exponential change," and "catalyst for the benefit of humanity," the non-profit and their annual, public XPRIZE competition are well on the way to meeting these goals. With sponsored, thematic prize categories ranging from life sciences to exploration, the competition has provided a global platform (not to mention funding) for innovations that include faster oil recovery cleanup, more energy-efficient vehicles, and a $2 billion private space industry.</p>

<p>Current, active prize competitions include <a href="http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/">Google’s Lunar XPRIZE</a>, <a href="http://www.qualcommtricorderxprize.org/">Qualcomm’s Tricorder XPRIZE</a>, and <a href="http://www.nokiasensingxchallenge.org/">Nokia’s Sensing XPRIZE</a>. Qualcomm’s Tricorder XPRIZE will allow fans of the <i>Star Trek</i> series to help bring the fictional, portable diagnostic device used by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_McCoy">"Bones"</a> to life.  A new learning prize was also announced this year and as Alan Zack, Senior Director of Marketing at XPRIZE, describes the goal of this new category to New Learning Times, "the competition aims to democratize learning and bring it to the hundreds of millions of children around the world who currently do not have regular access to quality schools or teachers." With hundreds of teams racing to compete for the current round of monetary prizes, it seems that the efforts of their highly visible board, which includes founders of Google, are paying off.</p>

<p><b>Out-of-this-world Education</b>
While the <a href="http://www.xprize.org/about/vision-circle">team of tech luminaries supporting the organization</a> is enviable, it is the group’s focus on educational outreach that is most impressive. As Zack describes, "education is core to our mission. Our strategy is to develop an educational outreach program that builds awareness and engagement among our audiences around the issues and how they can help make an impact." With efforts that include competitions for secondary and higher education learners and a <a href="http://www.xprize.org/prize-development/xprize-labs">dedicated learning lab and research partnership with MIT</a> (among others), the XPRIZE foundational work is providing real, on the ground benefit to the education sector. By building on digital and in-person learning opportunities, XPRIZE leaders hope that all of their educational programs will generate "breakthroughs in the way students approach the world" and inspire younger generations. After all, as Zack explained, among this group of young learners are, "… the future winners of our competitions and the shapers of our future."</p>
