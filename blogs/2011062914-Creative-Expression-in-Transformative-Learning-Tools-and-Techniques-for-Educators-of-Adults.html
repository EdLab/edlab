<strong>From the publisher: </strong>

Transformative learning is a theory of adult education that focuses on  the profound changes-or   transformations-that can occur in the lives of  adults. It is not as concerned with incremental advances in   learners'  knowledge as it is with their mental frameworks for making meaning from  life experiences. This book explores the role of creative expression in  this transformational process. It provides a practical and accessible  approach to using creative expression with adult learners. The book  provides various tools, methods and creative modalities that have been  used to promote transformative learning, and discusses how adult  educators themselves are transformative learners.

<strong>About the authors:</strong>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Chad Hoggan:</span> Born in Olathe, KS, Chad currently resides in Dayton with his spouse,  Kim, and children Marina, Cameron, and Natalia. He earned his B.S. from  Brigham Young University and M.S. from North Carolina State University.  He has almost completed his Ed.D. from Teachers College, Columbia  University.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Soni Simpson:</span> Dr. Simpson is a consultant  and trainer with an expertise in creativity, imagination and  innovation.  She has 20+ years of brand management and industry related  experience with multi-million dollar businesses.  Her academic  background includes teaching at DePaul University, the Yale Research  Institute-Great Lakes Institute of Management (Chennai, India) and  IIT/Stuart GSB, Elmhurst College, National Louis University and Robert  Morris College.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Heather Stuckey:</span> Dr. Stuckey’s research  focuses on improving the education, self-management support and  psychological distress of people with diabetes and other chronic  disease.  Using medical humanities-based models and problem-solving  techniques, she works with qualitatative methods (narrative, video,  arts-based inquiry, observations, interviews, focus groups) to determine  how adults make meaning of their illness and how the medical community  can respond to support patients and their families. She has been the  leader in developing web-site interventions that are built to help  people problem-solve by looking at strategies that have worked in  real-life scenarios.  Using her adult education background and  creativity, she takes a systems approach in not only improving  knowledge, but providing social and emotional support as part of her  interventions.  She has also co-edited a book on transformation and the  arts, and has written several NIH grants to become an expert in mixed  methods research applied to behavioral science.

Dr. Stuckey  serves on doctoral committees, assists multiple students at Penn State  Hershey with their Medical Student Research projects, and facilities  problem-based learning courses.  She completed a post-doctoral  appointment at Penn State Harrisburg in the Office of Research Affairs and at the Hershey Medical Center in Endocrinology. She was a fellow at the Office of Behavioral Social Sciences Research Randomized Clinical Trials in 2010.
