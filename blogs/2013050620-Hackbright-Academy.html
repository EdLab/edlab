<i>I learned far more in 10 weeks at Hackbright than I could have on my own. I came out of the program with an excellent foundation in web development and several finished projects to show employers</i>

<p>
<b>Hacking a Brighter Future for Female Programmers</b><br>
In a wave of "girls can code" initiatives, <a href="http://www.hackbrightacademy.com/">Hackbright Academy</a> stands out from the pack with a 10-week in-person training program that relies heavily on mentorship and emphasizes the importance of developing a female-focused community of practice.  Participants who are chosen for the $7,500 (there is a scholarship option and payment plan) San Francisco-based program learn software development and computer languages ranging from Python, Django, and Flask.  Beyond coding and gaining industry insight, the budding female engineers participating in Hackbright are nurtured through frequent in-person visits to Silicon Valley-area startups, a tailored speaker series and personalized job placement program. 
<p>
<b>Embracing the Mentor</b><br> 
It is this "turnkey" approach to professional education that both sets Hackbright apart and more closely resembles a traditional apprenticeship model, one which ironically has dominated male-focused fields like electrical engineering for decades if not centuries.  It is through this emphasis of one-on-one, in-person training that Hackbright provides unique value in the current "one-size-fits-most" alternative credentialing environment that goes long on online options and short on genuine personalization.  Many programs already in existence have mentorship models including <a href="http://www.starterleague.com/">The Starter League</a> (a mixed-sex mentorship-based program). However, Hackbright takes a truly unique girls-only approach.  Along with pioneering advocacy groups like the <a href="http://anitaborg.org/">Anita Borg Institute</a>, it is this female-centered approach to STEM learning paired with mentorship and professional development that just might be the formula needed to hook and retain female learners.  This idea of girl-friendly, apprenticeship-flavored learning builds on recent research into the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57428787/all-girl-classes-can-help-in-math-sciences/">value of all-girl STEM classes</a> in traditional educational settings.   
<p>
<b>Gaming the "Brogrammer" Game</b><br>
"Brogramming" culture may be at least partly to blame for an ever-decreasing number of girls who feel that computer programming is both a relevant and reachable field. Traditionally male-dominated, the field of computer engineering is starting to feel the effects of not welcoming women to the table.  From the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/07/tech/web/brogrammers/index.html">much maligned rise of "frat culture" in Silicon Valley</a> (well-documented early on in Po Bronson’s Valley send-up, <a href="http://www.pobronson.com/Nudist_Introduction.htm">"Nudist on the Late Shift"</a>) to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_computing">an increasingly anemic pool of qualified female technologists</a> women remain underrepresented in the STEM fields.  Hackbright Academy has now successfully graduated its second class and is currently relatively small-scale. However, this "little" fellowship program just might be a viable model for other girl-positive programs to follow.  If the fact that 8 out of 10 graduates in the last Hackbright class have found programming jobs (as reported in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/09/hackbright-academy/">TechCrunch</a>), this modest program just might provide something much more valuable than a traditional higher ed degree ever could, a job AND a seat at the boys’ table.
