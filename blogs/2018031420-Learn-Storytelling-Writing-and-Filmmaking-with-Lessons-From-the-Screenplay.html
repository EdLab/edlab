<p>YouTube has become a crucial outlet for education as it’s filled with with free lectures, how-to videos, and other informationals. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCErSSa3CaP_GJxmFpdjG9Jw/about">Lessons From the Screenplay</a> is part of this digital learning genre. This channel, hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/michaeltuckerla?lang=en/">Michael Tucker</a>, offers short videos that analyze writing, scene construction, and the mechanics of TV and films. A writer and filmmaker himself, Tucker hopes his lessons teach compelling storytelling and writing through popular cinema.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>The first thing to notice about Lessons From the Screenplay is its high production value. Clips and music are professionally cut together and displayed alongside script text or other writing resources. Tucker utilizes side-by-side comparisons of scripts and filmed scenes in order to show how the scenes were executed or changed. He also wonderfully explains the choices made by the filmmakers.</p> 

<p>The channel’s 7 to 14-minute lessons use popular culture that should attract a wide audience: from cult classics like <i>Blade Runner</i>, to bingeable shows such as <i>Game of Thrones</i> and <i>Breaking Bad</i>, to animated features like <i>Inside Out</i>. Sometimes he also connects these lessons across genre. For example, have you noticed the parallels between <i>Saving Private Ryan’s</i> battle scenes and those in <i>Game of Thrones</i>?</p> 

<p>Each lesson introduces serious concepts for writing or filmmaking, utilizing professional books or other resources that could easily be found in a classroom setting. For instance, while exploring the characteristics of film noir in <i>Blade Runner</i>, he cites the book <i>A Panorama of American Film Noir (1941-1953)</i> by Raymond Borde and Etienne Chaumeton. Likewise, he uses <i>The Anatomy of Story</i> by John Truby to illustrate the revelation sequence in <i>Ex Machina</i>. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Using popular culture for teaching could create distractions. The movies and clips are so entertaining that it’s easy to forget these videos are supposed to be educational. Teachers using these for classes will have to make sure to reinforce the learning aspects of these resources.</p>

<p>For those concerned about spoiler alerts, be warned: this channel spoils everything. If a viewer hasn’t seen a particular movie or show, they might want to steer clear of that lesson. Navigating spoiler alerts might be tough in large class settings. </p> 
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Lessons From the Screenplay is a great resource for storytelling or general writing courses. The production values are high, and Tucker carefully cites professional learning resources in each lesson. However, the channel should not replace curriculum for classes; rather, it should be used to bolster class activities.</p>
