            <h5 style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:20pt;margin-bottom:11pt;">Reflections</h5><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:11pt;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Tuesday's D&amp;R meeting transported me back to spring--to my time working as a substitute teacher with the Boulder Valley School District (BVSD) and to the political advocacy to which my observations from this unique position led me. At the time, BVSD had invested in thousands of Chromebooks and had deployed them across hundreds of classrooms in tens of schools, hoping to revolutionize education in the district and simultaneously to join the innovation rat-race spurred on by the likes of Google and other technology giants. Yet what I saw first-hand was far from the reality the district’s Chief Technology Officer had promised. Indeed, by and large this particular intervention has flopped. There were few administrative structures in place, limited and insufficient training, and undefined expectations--among other management and implementation oversights.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:11pt;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">So I started speaking out at meetings of the Board of Education, meeting with the superintendent, and meeting with members of the Board, in each case sharing my observations and arguing that the present implementation put too much responsibility on students and lacked those structures that could facilitate engagement and authentic learning. And soon I had joined the then-nascent advocacy efforts of concerned parents, whose concerns expanded my perspective, revolving primarily around data privacy and around content filtering.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:11pt;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Although I left the district in May to begin my regular summer work with the Colorado Outward Bound School, parents’ activism and my own heightened sense of agency inspired me to stay in contact and to support their efforts from afar. Taking to the keyboard--as they don’t say--I began in on an extended investigative-opinion project, at the heart of which would be five long-form articles that explored this debate: to technologize or not to technologize? I hoped to bring in my own perspectives, to develop the arguments I was hashing out in personal conversations, and to present at least some academic research on the issue. So were born some 22,000 words, with the final installment slated to go live by the end of this calendar year.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:11pt;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">I share all of this, of course, because the Verizon 5G EdTech Challenge begs some of the questions at the heart of this series of articles: why do we need technology in our classrooms; does it actually do our students any good; if so, which students benefit the most and which lose out; could effort and money be directed to more impactful interventions; and what are the effects of our rhetoric around technology use on other academic subjects or on school culture? The issue is complicated, no doubt, and I am still working through my own assessments of these questions. Nonetheless, I believe these are worthwhile questions, especially in the face of what appears to be an ever-accelerating technology craze and an ever-dwindling penchant for introspection and reflection.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:11pt;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">With that, I wanted to share an excerpt from the beginning of my second article and to link to each of these articles on my personal site, where I hope you will find interesting and challenging ideas alike.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:11pt;background-color:#ffffff;"><a href="https://nikita-bogdanov.com/2018/07/30/technology-in-the-classroom-i/" style="text-decoration:none;"><span

I, Introduction:</span></a><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"> </span><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">This brief installment serves as an introduction to the many installments that follow and provides a broad overview of the questions in play.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:11pt;background-color:#ffffff;"><a href="https://nikita-bogdanov.com/2018/08/15/technology-in-the-classroom-ii/" style="text-decoration:none;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#1155cc;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Part II, Educative or Miseducative:</span></a><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"> Here I apply Dewey’s educative-miseducative distinction to the technology use debate and propose it as one possible conceptual framework from which we can approach this issue.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:11pt;background-color:#ffffff;"><a href="https://nikita-bogdanov.com/2018/08/30/technology-in-the-classroom-part-iii/" style="text-decoration:none;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#1155cc;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Part III, My Reality:</span></a><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"> This installment focuses on my observations as a substitute teacher and presents a line of argument that explores how social inequality maps onto and interacts with technology interventions in classrooms.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:11pt;background-color:#ffffff;"><a href="https://nikita-bogdanov.com/2018/10/23/technology-in-the-classroom-part-iv-research/" style="text-decoration:none;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#1155cc;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Part IV, Argument and Research:</span></a><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"> In this penultimate installment I bring in education technology research and engage with the two most common rebuttals to the arguments laid out in the previous installment.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:11pt;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">It is worth noting--and emphasizing--that I am not against technology in classrooms. Rather, what I resist, and often resent, is the displacement of students, teachers, and the process of authentic learning by technocentric interventions that sing their own praises and promote their own goals while ignoring important contextual factors and bigger systemic inequalities. In short, I resist education technology that is more about technology than it is about education. Though not categorically problematic, such an approach I believe leads to fragile digital interventions, to ones that have a higher risk of failing or of missing the educational mark. All of which is to say: given the central position education technology occupies at EdLab, we seem to have before us the unique opportunity of pioneering a student-centered model of technology innovation, against the grain of current trends.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:11pt;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">I know that I am new--indeed, this is only my fifth day of work--and I hope that you will excuse me if I’ve gone too far here. And yet from my interactions thus far, EdLab seems like an organization open to this sort of feedback, to these types of ideas. Ultimately, then, the reason I am writing now is to contribute some of the challenging and interesting perspectives from my previous work in education to the rich, ongoing conversations at here, at EdLab.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:11pt;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Let me know what you think...</span></p><h5 style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:11pt;">An Excerpt</h5><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:11pt;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">This morning, as I enter the familiar room, I am met alternately with looks of shame of anger and of indifference. Yet with many more months under my belt—the memory of the last time I stepped into this room painfully playing out on repeat in my mind and in my body—on this day I come equipped with more grit, with new tools, and with an understanding of the challenges I may face. Today, for instance, though I am usually reluctant to send students to the office, I have resolved to employ this dimension of my authority with swift—and early on. Simultaneously, in an active attempt to forestall the need for such action at all, I begin every period by standing outside the door, by greeting my students in hopes of beginning to build the very relationships I am sure I will shortly be required to leverage. You see, as </span><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/rita_pierson_every_kid_needs_a_champion" style="text-decoration:none;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#ca9b52;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Rita Pierson</span></a><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"> says, kids don’t listen to people they don’t like.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:11pt;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Earlier on in the year, when I first worked with this class, I was still woefully new to the job and still finding my substitute persona. In my naiveté, I made the mistake of caring too much and of owning too much. Faced with a classroom on the verge of eruption, with blatant disregard and disrespect, with an organized affront to my quixotic idealism, I held back tears as I pleaded with students to engage, to care, to put away their phones; I deployed all the tools I had to de-escalate and to excite; I tried desperately to focus on the behavior and not on the individual.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:11pt;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">And yet, I was met with a vexing, nonchalant resistance: phones on desks, games on screens, attention scattered. At a loss, I finally revealed the few teeth I had, threatening to begin sending students to the office. At a loss again, I asked several students to see the Principal. At a loss again, my request was met with a staunch civil disobedience—comfortably, these students remained stationary. At one point, after a frantic call to the front office, the Assistant Principal, with a swift series of glances and an iron presence, quelled the commotion and relieved me of my stresses, but only long enough to make it out of the classroom on the way to the next crisis. We, our schools and our society, have failed these students.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:11pt;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">When I originally accepted this assignment, I was woefully unaware that I was signing up to work with one of the most difficult classes the seasoned teaching staff at Casey Middle School had in many years seen. As a whole, I would later discover, this class was legendary: moving up through the grades, they left inedible impressions on the heroic teachers charged with showing them their better selves.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:11pt;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">They were not, many teachers would tell me, bad individuals—indeed, as teachers, can we ever capitulate to the grand American mythology that blames the individual, that marks the individual without considering her context?—but simply very connected. Though at the time this characterization referenced only their extreme fidelity to each other, over the coming months of reflection I would come to realize that such a description spoke not only to their social connections, but also to their digital ones: it poignantly identified the rampant digital delinquency that so plagued this class. Casey’s 8</span><span style="font-size:6.8999999999999995pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:super;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">th</span><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"> graders were, in all relevant senses of the word, then, connected.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:11pt;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">The lesson plan for today calls for students to finish an online test, no doubt mandated by some entity of the state. Yet the very connection that complicated my first experience with this class today frustrates the completion of this task: how are students to remain focused if they have become accustomed to browsing their phones and the Internet alike? Shortly after the bells rings, I notice this dynamic of distraction come into play, as one student in particular, Joey, decides to divide his attention between the test in front of him and the open forum of the Internet, where he seeks out one of the multitude of games accessible on the school’s network. Although I provide this student with two warnings, and fully disclose the consequences of failing to stay on task, within ten minutes of the beginning of the period I am forced to ask this student to go to the office.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:11pt;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Yes, what sends this student away is ultimately his decision to once again return to distraction. Of course, it is also I that send him away, seemingly unable to strike the balance I so desire, between being firm and being compassionate. Finally, what also sends this student away is a consistent lack of structure and a consistent lack of appropriate support—either at home or at school.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:11pt;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Within minutes of a departure preceded by vehement opposition and denial, Brenna, a student who has already completed this exercise in measurement—who now reclines on the couch, her neurons with each minute becoming more and more accustomed to the frenetic screen in front of her and less and less to the literary worlds that line the shelves of the room—, within minutes she mumbles in ambivalent surprise and in mild annoyance: “OMG, Joey won’t stop sending me Snaps.” Joey, the student whom I just asked to leave, the student whom the staff at the front office has just told me is now beside them—Joey, it seems cannot bear his circumstances, and so for the next several minutes, like an inside informant, he bombards Brenna with a multitude of digital parcels of resentment.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:11pt;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Mind you, I have been informed that it is not unusual for students who have completed their work to be given discretionary time, during which they are free to use their phones and computers as they see fit. Yet however discretionary such time may be for students, it is well worth noting that for the taxpayers who support the public education system, there is nothing discretionary about the funding directed to this enterprise, perhaps because it is so crucially important to our democracy, to our society, and to the individuals who populate these systems. At least, so the popular rhetoric dictates—regardless of the deficient reality that defines so many of our individual schools.</span></p><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-cec9d2ed-7fff-504c-eff8-679e4731766b"></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:11pt;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#464646;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Yes, this class is very connected—and in more ways than the superannuated interpersonal paradigm can even begin to count.</span></p>
