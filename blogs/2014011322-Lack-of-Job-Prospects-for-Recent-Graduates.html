          <p>
            Last week, I did a research about majors in college and how it helps or hurts a graduate's chance of landing a job after college. By doing this, I found some videos that I posted on Vialogues to further explore and explain this theme. Most of the findings were really interesting and in a nutshell I must say that most graduates do not find jobs after college, especially in their <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/12932">area of study</a>. Apart from a lack of jobs, they are in debt after taking out heavy loans to finance their college education. Why are graduates not landing jobs? Is it because of their majors in college? 

I decided to learn more about how one goes about choosing a college major. After watching this <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/12937">video</a>, I discovered that choosing a major is all about having a passion in something and doing what you love. Additionally, your major in college does not necessarily decide what you will do in the future. Most college students graduate from college and land a job different from their major. Some might ask, if college does not determine our future, why should we waste time and enroll in college only to be in debt when we can pursue our passions? What if our interest requires us to have a college degree? 

This is a <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/12953">global</a> problem. This video also shows how unemployment in Europe is increasing among the youth. What do we need to do to resolve this ongoing crisis?
