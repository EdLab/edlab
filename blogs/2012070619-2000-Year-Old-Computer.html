            Computers are what I believe to be the most phenomenal piece of technology there is in the world.  However, if someone was to ask me how long computers has been around, I would have never expected the answer to be <a href ="http://www.humansinvent.com/#!/7280/the-antikythera-mechanism-inside-the-worlds-first-computer/">2000 years old!</a>

Scientists have discovered a 2000 year old computer. In addition, they believe that it was the first computing device ever. This object was found off a Greek island called Antikythera and was used by the ancient Greeks.  Michael Wright studied the Antikythera mechanism and even build his own model. What can this 2000 year old computer do one may ask? The data is entered into the device by using the levers, which moves the gears inside and then the device can tell a person both the position of the moon and the sun at the same time. It can also give a person the phases of the moon. Evidently, the Greeks used a lunar calendar instead of a solar calendar and one cannot fit the number of lunar months into a year. This is based on the metonic cycle where 235 full moons can almost fit perfectly in a span of 19 years. 

Antikythera mechanism was invented between 150-100 BCE and was incredibly advanced for its time period.  As a computer engineering major, this antique caught my interest and makes me wonder if there are any other foreign technologies out there that we do not know of.  It's interesting to discover this piece of computer history, watch this Vialogue below to learn more.
