            The Windows app store which will be introduced with the Windows 8 OS, shipping off beta version in late February, aims to fill the black holes in competitor app stores and bring greater flexibility and transparency for the developers, or in the words of Antoine Leblond, a corporate vice president for Windows Web Services: "giving you a bigger bite of the Apple".

So how is Windows app store going to do that ? 

By obviously making the app store more favorable for developers. Developers will get a <b>revenue share</b> of 70% (just like Apple), but when an app makes $25K in revenue, that share will scale up to 80% for the lifetime of the app. Of-course, now if you are a developer of Angry Birds, this might help in building your revenue, but for smaller apps which never hit the mark, the scale would mean nothing.  However, the paid apps will start from $1.49 (as compared to 99 cents in the Apple model, which has proved to work pretty well).  

Developers will get <b>analytics</b> on how their apps are selling to allow them to focus on their customers effectively. Further, the app store will streamline the process of submitting an app to the store, by allowing developers to <b>track their application</b> and see how long the process might take. When their apps are rejected, they will get <b>feedback</b> to address the issues quickly and resubmit the app for publication. If/When there is any change in the policy of the app store, and a log of changes will be published to ensure greater transparency. 

The app store would be <b>available worldwide</b> where Windows is available, so roughly in 231 markets, in 100 different languages and local currencies. 
Further, according to the previous years statistics shared by Microsoft, Windows 7 sold 500 million copies, as compared to 247 million devices running Android, and 152 million devices running iOS in the last years. So this would be a huge huge opportunity for developers to participate in the app store by designing <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh464920.aspx">Metro Style apps</a>. Microsoft has also already held a <a href="https://buildwindowscontest.com/">First AppsContest </a>for developers to contest in getting their Windows app to feature in Windows store beta. 

Could Windows store really be the panacea to app developers' woes or would there be an IE overhead (and other perhaps) ?
