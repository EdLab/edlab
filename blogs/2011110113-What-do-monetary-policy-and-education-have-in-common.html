Absolutely nothing...but maybe not for long. On Friday, I was looking uncharacteristically sharp because I had participated in a monetary policy competition called Fed Challenge where I, and four others, represented Columbia University. The competition consists of two parts, a presentation and a q&a session. The presentation is a simulation of the FOMC meeting (which is currently going on now) where FOMC members discuss the current macroeconomic situation, the policy options, and the best course of action for policy. The question and answer session that follows is a chance for a panel of three or so judges to ask the team questions relevant to the presentation as well basic questions on market mechanisms and macroeconomic theory. Overall, it makes for challenging and exhilarating competition in which your critical thinking skills are in top gear and your knowledge of fundamental concepts are tested quite objectively. The Columbia team has moved on to the semi-finals, where we and five other Fed Challenge teams from the tri-state area will vie for a spot in the National Fed Challenge competition. 
In light of all of this, I have given some serious thought to developing a competition for education policy. Obviously education policy is much broader and less organized than monetary policy. Nevertheless, I think a competition with a similar format could be created. The area I think makes the most sense is federal higher education policy. While the dual goals for monetary policy is full employment and price stability, the dual goals for higher education policy are expanded access and quality and minimal cost and deadweight loss. Federal higher education comes in the form of subsidies, loans, and distance/online learning efforts [EdLab Relevance]. Having students present their analysis of the current state of higher education, given what the latest research from education and economics says, and then arriving at a policy proposal could really work in my view. We could get a panel of experts from Teachers College and Columbia's Economics Department to judge the teams. Such a competition would probably have to be piloted at the intra-school level (within TC) first. If we could garner enough interest (say 25 students) and then make a pilot one-day competition, where students would be given research at the beginning of the day to help prepare a presentation and then be ready to take q&a on their analysis and proposal(s) after they present to the panel of judges in the evening, we could really have something here. Ultimately, we could have interscholastic competition like there is for Fed Challenge, but between education schools (Harvard v. Columbia anyone?).
