Schools and libraries are increasingly seeing the value of programs that allow students to read to pets in order to boost reading skills. To date, such animal-assisted literacy programs are currently operating in 43 states throughout the U.S., as well as in Canada, the UK, Italy and India.<sup>1 </sup>In fact, as research into the growing numbers of programs such as the Marin Humane Society’s <a href="http://www.marinhumanesociety.org/site/c.aiIOI3NLKgKYF/b.7727647/k.9371/SHARE_a_Book.htm" target="_blank">SHARE a book program</a> in California, <a href="www.leapreading.org" target="_blank">Literacy Education Assistance Pups (LEAP)</a> in Delaware and <a href="www.nctdinc.org" target="_blank">Canine-Assisted Reading Education (CARE)</a> in  Washington, DC would seem to suggest, reluctant or struggling readers may in fact be finding substantial gains in reading aloud to dogs and cats.

Literacy programs that rely on animal companions have their roots in the movement of “pet therapy,” a term that was first coined by child psychologist Boris Levinson in 1961.<sup>2</sup> In a 1986 study, Filiatre, Millot, and Montagner found that young children who were often shy increased their confidence levels and communication when they interacted with dogs.<sup>2</sup> Building on the benefits of bringing dogs into therapy settings, reading programs began to crop up across the country, one of the oldest and most active being Reading Education Assistance Dogs (READ), which was founded in 1999 by Sandi Martin of Intermountain Therapy Animals in Salt Lake City, Utah. Since its founding, the organization has participated in several studies on the outcomes of its programs. In one longitudinal study of children aged five to nine, children’s reading scores improved markedly from one year to the next<sup>.3</sup> Among the groups who participated in the study, teachers also noticed “decreased absenteeism, increased use of the library, and improved grades on report cards.”<sup>3</sup>

Perhaps the greatest benefit of pet-assisted literacy programs, however, is the impact they appear to be having on reluctant readers. In a 2011 study by Bassette, reading programs that relied on bringing a pet dog into the classroom were found to potentially “impact student motivation in reading activities.”<sup>4</sup> More recently, a classroom teacher in Tampa, Florida brought her dog to school and noticed that her students showed an increase in “self-confidence, oral fluency and overall motivation to read.”<sup>2</sup> In classroom settings, libraries and other institutions, educators are increasingly commenting on how dogs and other companion animals provide a nonjudgmental audience for students to practice reading aloud and improve their overall reading fluency.

Parents and teachers interested in enrolling their kids in animal-assisted reading programs can contact a local office of a national organization such as READ, or get in touch with a nearby animal shelter who can help them find local dog therapy groups which visit local schools.<sup>3</sup> It goes without saying that the animals who visit schools must be specifically trained to work with young learners; they must enjoy being pet, must know basic commands, and cannot be frightened by the loud noises which occur in the classroom or local library. The process for volunteering or enlisting your pet is often quite lengthy, but can also be very rewarding!

Thinking of getting your own kids or the children in your local school to love books by having them practice reading aloud to a sociable dog or cat? Try some of the following stories about animals available at the library at Teachers College, which are sure to amuse both kids and pets alike!
