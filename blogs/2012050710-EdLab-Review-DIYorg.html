DIY.org is a new online community for children to create an online portfolio to share their real-world, Do-It-Yourself projects with the world. DIY.org states goals for the platform ranging from helping to prepare kids for 21st century careers to preparing them for an education that will increasingly emphasize creative problem-solving. DIY.org states on their site, "Encouraging your kids to be inventive and self-reliant now will better prepare them to participate in a world that keeps changing."

Parents are able to take an active role in their child's interactions on DIY.org through a "parent's dashboard" that provides metrics on what and when their children are sharing. Additionally, parents are able to award virtual "stickers" to their kid's work. Beyond stickers, participants' identities are masked by made-up names and intricately illustrated animal-based avatars.  

<b>Pros:</b>
The parent dashboard seems like an innovative way to handle increasing privacy concerns and, for a parent who wants to stay involved in their child's online extracurricular activities, it offers valuable insight.

<b>Cons:</b>
"Prove you're not a robot!" is a prompt you receive when you try to set up an account and is accompanied by a request that you provide your parent's email address. This seems a bit sneaky (see screenshot below)... couldn't parents set up an account for their kids? I would resent a company that asks my child for my personal email address without my permission.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> 
The parent's dashboard is an interesting feature. As we explore the role of dashboards in our own applications here at the EdLab, it is interesting to explore the potential of these dashboards to keep educators and parents abreast of learning and interactions that take place in online education.  

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
In an ed-space that increasingly demands critical, creative thinking, DIY.org has created a safe, online space for children to share projects they created while offline and away from school.
