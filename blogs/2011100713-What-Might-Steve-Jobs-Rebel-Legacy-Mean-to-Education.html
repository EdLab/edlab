            <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/58572505@N04/6220141541/" title="Steve Jobs BMW  by CuriousBrooklyn, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6217/6220141541_d73f7361ac_z.jpg" width="635" height="473" alt="Steve Jobs BMW "></a>

Steve Jobs was one of the original rebel/geeks... easily straddling both the lines of tech nerddom and outsider coolness.  I think more than almost any other figure in history (can you think of anyone who has had more of an impact across so many fields?)  Mr. Jobs created an aura of hipness around technology, its use, development and dissemination.  This marriage of beautiful design with incredible functionality is a hallmark of Apple products and did not exist prior to early releases like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac">iMac</a>.

Perhaps it is this duality of form & function finally being united that has helped to make being a "programmer" truly cool?  Prior to this era, if you were involved with technology, computer science, engineering and/or design (drafting in the early days) you weren't necessarily considered a rockstar or even remotely sociable, one only has to look as far back as the classic cult favorite <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089886/">"Real Genius"</a> to get a feeling for what I mean.   "Cool" and computer programmer just didn't exist together prior to Apple's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_Different">"Think Different"</a> campaign.  It is this campaign's elevation of the benefits of being "weird" or "crazy" that cemented Apple's place in the hearts of rebel nerds-in-training the world over.  Like Luke Skywalker, they waited for their Obi One and he arrived in a black turtleneck and jeans. 

<b>How might you ask, does this effect education?</b>
As I begin to posit above, the "coolness" factor around technology and computer science is an unmeasurable, direct result of Steve Jobs' Jedi Knight status and Apple's ability through their products, tools and marketing to inspire masses of loyal fans.  Today you only have to look at sources as random as women in "I â™¡ Nerds" tee-shirts to the record-breaking virtual attendance of <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6362">Stanford's online engineering classes</a> to get a feeling for the "coolness" factor that is burgeoning in the worlds of tech and science.   Additionally, and perhaps most tellingly, interest in, and attendance of Computer Science programs has <a href="http://www.cra.org/govaffairs/blog/2010/03/cra-taulbee-report-cs-enrollments-new-majors-up-for-2nd-straight-year/">increased steadily</a> over the past few years.  Finally, young students interested in technology have a quiet, powerful rebel/nerd to guide their way and who, thanks to his insistence on "thinking differently" allows them to consider careers in computer science as truly, unequivocally cool.
