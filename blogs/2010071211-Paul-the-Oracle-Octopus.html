            Paul the Oracle Octopus is being looked at as an important figure after the end of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa as it has correctly predicted the outcome of some of the key games. It all started after he predicted wins for Germany in all their group stage games against Australia and Ghana. 
 
 
Many may have not had any interest in those predictions because the Octopus is just an animal and looking at the quality players in Germany's squad, they were somewhat expected to win all games in their group.
 
However things got interesting as the tournament progressed and Paul kept having his way with predictions. As Germany faced tougher and stronger opponents in the next round of the tournament, England in the round of 16, Argentina in the quarter-finals and Spain in the semifinals, there was a tense wait to see if the octopus could continue his impressive run of predictions. The octopus predicted wins for Germany in their round of 16 and quarter final matches. Even though the animal was based in Germany, it predicted a win for Spain over Germany in the semi-final proving to people and maybe drawing the attention of many that its not just picking Germany in order to favor his country but picking a team that would surely win. After Germany lost that game in the semi-final, the octopus was the subject of numerous death threats from angry German fans. It further got exciting when Paul the Oracle Octopus had to predict a game that did not involve Germany for the first time. It picked Spain to win the World Cup and as it stands today Spain were the winners of the 2010 World Cup. 
 
Some countries have already started to claim that the octopus was found in their river and others have even made offers to buy the animal. Paul the oracle Octopus was just a normal animal who made his name on Germany's games but has now drawn the attention from people all over the world.
