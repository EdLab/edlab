<i> Boot Camp participants will learn critical business and communication skills to help them develop their venture, no matter what stage they’re in. It’s an exciting place to meet other entrepreneurs, share ideas, and build connections.

<b>Starting Out With a Pitch Competition </b><br>
<p>

The <a href=" http://www.socialenterprisebootcamp.org/about/ "> Social Enterprise Boot Camp </a> is an annual event hosted by Columbia University, The School of Visual Arts, and New York University.  With the unique objective of fostering learning among social innovators and encouraging collaboration among these three New York-based universities, the 2012 two-day event started out with a bang. 12 social innovators went head-to-head as they pitched their ideas in hopes of winning a $3,000 prize to support their work. Because the conference was aimed at nurturing learning relevant to social entrepreneurship, pitchers received in-depth feedback from the judges on how to improve their elevator pitch for future venues. In the end,  <a href=" http://www.sungiantenergy.com/ "> the winner was Sun Giant Energy </a>, an initiative started by NYU undergraduate students to "provide clean, affordable solar energy to Liberia." Sun Giant Energy co-founder Steven Rasovsky exclaimed, "…the feedback I got was incredible…. All of the projects were so inspiring and watching people present on such a diverse array of projects from all around the world… it gets you energized." 
<p>
<b>Practical Training for the Aspiring Social Innovator </b><br>
<p>
The following day, workshops started bright and early and were organized around themes. At any given moment four sessions were running simultaneously. The first set of workshops focused on legal and structural issues, the next slot focused on financial topics, the third track was about design, and the final sessions focused on impact. Workshops stressed practical takeaways, like how to run a successful crowdfunding campaign or how to talk about an initiative in a succinct and powerful way. The 4-track curriculum revolved around crucial entrepreneurial skills, and sessions were tagged as Master or Fundamental so participants could customize their conference experience to meet their learning needs. The event concluded with keynote speaker, Laura Galinsky of <a href=" http://www.echoinggreen.org/ "> Echoing Green</a>. She encouraged participants to reflect carefully on how they can combine their passions with their talents to optimize a meaningful professional future. She asked practical questions of the audience such as, "What social circles do you have the access to? What are your areas of expertise?" She also encouraged participants not to think about what they wish to do "when they grow up" but instead the kind of impact they wish to make in the world. 
<p>
<b> Connecting with Other Social Entrepreneurs </b><br>

<p>
The energy of the conference was upbeat and participants had positive things to say. One of the conference goers excitedly explained, "I came to Boot Camp to meet other fellow social entrepreneurs and be inspired by their ideas …. It was an amazing experience!" With around 150 participants, the conference seemed an ideal size to make meaningful connections. The conference encouraged participants to learn from one another through interactive sessions and frequent breaks throughout the day that fostered interaction.  In the spirit of social entrepreneurship, a $10 donation from every Boot Camp entry ticket was given to the American Red Cross to support those immediately affected by Hurricane Sandy. What was unique about the conference was that novices and experts alike received hands-on practical information aimed at fostering their social entrepreneurial initiatives. Considering the current trend in entrepreneurship, the conference seemed to hit the mark of meeting the needs of today’s learner.
