<p>The <a href="http://www.boulderjourneyschool.com">Boulder Journey School</a> began in 1984 as a one hour parent-child arts and crafts class. By 1993 it had grown into a full-day, full-year school program modeled after the educational philosophy of the schools in Reggio Emilia, Italy. The program and building were designed around core values of collaboration, creativity, and a strong image of the child and of the adult.</p>

<p>From the time the youngest student enters at 6 months old till the time the oldest student graduates at 6 years old, teachers work to observe and document the children and design customized classroom tools and toys to enhance their learning. Each design decision is based on both documentation and dialogue amongst teachers about the children, which allows teachers to reflect on and evolve their own practices as they grow alongside the student. Two-thirds of the faculty are comprised of teachers-in-training who are participating in a teacher education program during their time at the Journey School.</p>

<p>This video, filmed in June 2014, features interviews with Executive Director Ellen Hall and Education Director Alison Maher, as well as footage of a day in the school showing the way students interact with the various resources and spaces for play and investigation.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:00 welmer:</b> It is funny how kids that age don't walk, they run everywhere. The designers took that into consideration when building the school. It really doesn't resemble a school at all.</p>

<p><b>@01:16 danahuagh:</b> Are students with all types of learning-levels accepted?</p>

<p><b>@01:16 alison.maher:</b> Yes, the curriculum is developed based on the strengths and goals of the individual and the group. This is achieved through a process of observation, documentation, reflection, provocation and action.</p>
