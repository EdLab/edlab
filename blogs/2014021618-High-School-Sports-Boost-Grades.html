          <p>
            Several people have the notion that sports affects most high school student athletes negatively in terms of their grades and dropout rates. Numerous articles have supported the claim that, schools in America pay too much attention to sports and that eventually causes them to lose track of their students' academic progress. A consequence of this is an increase in the drop out rates of schools. However, in contrast, this <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/10/high-school-sports-arent-killing-academics/280155/">article</a> highlights that, sports actually help schools academically. Research conducted by Harvard University shows that the math scores of students in Massachusetts is comparable to the math scores of their peers in South Korea and Finland. Apparently schools in Massachusetts provide sports programs while schools in Finland do not.

Sports in high schools should be encouraged because the article also highlights that, in addition to helping decrease dropout rates, it also helps students socialize with families and friends during games, practices and other athletic events. I would say sports don't hinder good academic performance but sports only direct student athletes towards getting desirable grades and also deters them from dropping out of school.
