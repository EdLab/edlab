          <p>
            I recently came up with some ideas on what I can do to make the most use of learning resources, since I am trying to find a way that can stimulate myself.
<p>
What could be the best stimulation for learners when they are enrolled in a MOOC or any other learning resources? In schools and colleges, we have permanent academic records (e.g. GPA and transcripts) and academic awards that could be closely related to further study and career paths. At least, in college or other offline schools, we might work hard on academic study just because we know the tuition is expensive. All these are “good” stimulations for learners. :)
<p>
On the other hand, we may feel MOOCs are “cheap”, and won't put more than 80% of our efforts in them. In a sense, this could be a huge inefficiency: spend more time to get less knowledge.
<p>
What is a good stimulation? As far as I can see, an obvious one that is used by nearly all MOOCs is visible statistics. Some examples are like below:

Learners can see their progresses and make reasonable schedules for further studies.
<p>
Some mobile MOOC applications even push notifications everyday to remind you to complete the daily work.
<p>
Another case is a learning community like “study groups” formed by the students themselves. I never tried this, but I can imagine there is someone would like to be my study partner. As a result, I will be more likely to do more thinking and discussions. 
<p>
Community example:

<p>
Finally, MOOCs such as Coursera and Udacity have value-added service - course completion certifications, which works the same way like tuitions as stimulations.
<p>
Is there any better way? Or what else can we do?
