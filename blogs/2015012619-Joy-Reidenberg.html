<a href="http://bit.ly/1AC3XeH">Dr. Joy Reidenberg</a> is comparative anatomist and passionate advocate for the world’s largest mammals, whales. Additionally, Dr. Reidenberg is a Professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York and a regular contributor to public television programs such as, <a href="http://to.pbs.org/1wFnWJ7"><i>Inside Nature's Giants</i></a> and <a href="http://to.pbs.org/1wCh408"><i>Sex in the Wild</i></a>. A sought-after speaker, Dr. Reidenberg enjoys sharing a passion for science that she cultivated as a high schooler with audiences of all ages. Dr. Reidenberg holds a B.A. in Animal Anatomy and Physiology from Cornell University, College of Arts & Sciences and a M.Phil./Ph.D. from Mount Sinai Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Biomedical Sciences Doctoral Training Program.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> My interest in anatomy began as a child, but I didn’t know it then.  Although I liked to watch live animals, examining dead ones in the kitchen while preparing food gave me my first opportunity to see them up close.  I also liked drawing what I observed in nature.  My liking for animal structure intensified in college, particularly through courses in anatomy.  I even took my boyfriend on a date to see a dissection of a porpoise.  Who does that for a date?  Luckily, he married me anyway!  I spent a college summer dissecting fish and making drawings for a dissection manual.  That experience showed me that I could combine art skills and my fascination with nature.  I realized that if I add my nerdy desire to ask lots of questions and my passion to explore, these beautifully meshed into a career called comparative anatomy research. 
<p>
My educational trajectory began at Cornell University, College of Arts and Sciences (B.A., 1983). I obtained M.Phil. (1985) and Ph.D., 1988) degrees from the Graduate School of Biological Sciences at Mount Sinai.  Currently, I am a professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in New York City.  I teach Structures (Gross Anatomy, Histology, Embryology, Imaging) to medical students.  In addition, I do research in comparative anatomy.  I study and compare the structures of the bodies of animals adapted to extreme environments to better understand how those unique solutions work.  My goal is to develop new medical treatments or protective devices for people based upon mimicking nature’s adaptations.

<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 
<b>Answer:</b> I feel it is our responsibility, as scientists, to educate the public about science.  Therefore, I have become more active in bringing science education to the public through my work in fact-checked TV documentaries such as <i>Inside Nature’s Giants</i> and <i>Sex in the Wild</i> (both aired on PBS). 

<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? <br>
<b>Answer:</b> Self-education is a growing trend, particularly as skyrocketing tuition makes higher education unobtainable.  Learning is moving out of the classroom, textbooks, and journals.  People prefer to seek information from readily available resources such as television and internet.  I hope peer-review and professional input into on-line resources will help these sources become less subjective, opinion-based, deceptive, and propaganda-motivated, and instead become more fact-based with up-to-date current research findings.  At least I hope we can eliminate "mock-u-mentaries" that hoodwink the public into believing they are real science documentaries.  I’m angry about the recent Mermaids and Megalodon TV programs that misled the public with blatant lies, falsified re-enactments, and fabricated CGI animations.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> My current research is on how aquatic mammals manage the air resources in their bodies, including generating sounds, regulating buoyancy and swimming, and preventing respiratory tract damage during diving.  
<p>
My next big project is to understand how whales (including dolphins/porpoises) avoid getting decompression sickness (the bends), even though they are air breathing, diving mammals.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I tweet (<a href="https://twitter.com/JoyReidenberg"target="blank">@JoyReidenberg</a>) fun facts and answer questions when I am in documentaries airing on TV.  However, I’m not following anyone now because I was getting too many notices.</p>
