          <p>
            People argue about how employers and investors should go about offering jobs often. What should be the <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~fheapblog/id10.html">credentials</a> and achievements needed to be given a job? In discussions I've had with people, education is the number one qualification but what is the level of education needed to perform in a professional environment? Personally I believe education and the educational system are somehow inflated because profit is the main motive that drives many institutions. A tiny elite once held college degrees but now large populations of Americans hold a college degree. This effect has declined the value of a bachelor's degree and promoted the need to earn a higher level education.  

Higher level education such as masters and doctorate are important in order to avoid competition in finding a job. Masters and doctorate do not define an individual's intellect or job performance however, it is a way for employers and investors to put their faith in someone holding these credentials although they might not need them to perform their job. In the 1970s, as competition for managerial positions grew among those with baccalaureate degrees, M.B.A's became popular and eventually became the new way to corporate jobs.  In theory the principle of credential of inflation could go until  janitors and babysitters are require to have Ph.D.s and people could be in school in their 40s or longer just to earn the confidence of their employers. In the video below, a company called Inside Enstitue shows a new approach to developing professionals through an apprenticeship system. This system allows an individual to earn credentials from school and experience from learning with a professional.
