          <p>
            In this modern world, the rapid growth of social network platforms is caused by the rapid growth of technology. Some people use social network to feel socially alive, to make new friends and to feel part of this modern generation. On the other hand, other people's use of social networks are landing them in trouble due to what has been deemed unacceptable and threatening posts.

In recent <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/07/01/197669495/texas-teen-jailed-for-sarcastic-facebook-comment">news</a>, a Texas teenager was thrown behind bars to serve eight years for a “sarcastic Facebook comment.” According to NPR news, the teenager, Justin Carter, will be serving eight years in prison and be will be released if $500,000 is paid, an amount that his family and friends are struggling to raise. Justin found himself in this predicament after he got into an argument with someone on Facebook while playing the video game, League of Legends. The intensity of the argument provoked Justin to write this comment “I'm going to go shoot up a school full of kids and eat their still, beating hearts…” 

Justin's father, Jack Carter, defended his son by claiming that he doesn't know any current news and didn't realize what he was doing. Not that I am against Mr. Carter's claim to defend his child, but what baffles me is how can an 18-year-old can make such a serious comment and not know about the eventual consequences. In other words, Justin must have witnessed or heard of a school shooting case to have the idea of doing something similar, although he might have been just joking. As his father states, it was a sarcastic comment, a comment that had “lol” and “jk” (Just Kidding) at the end. But how many people mean it when they write an abbreviation like  “lol”? 

Nevertheless, no state deputy or police department will care if five "lol" were put after “terroristic threats,” which is what Justin is being charged for and a third degree felony. Please free feel to share your thoughts, whether Justin deserves to be serving eight years behind bars or to be pardoned because he didn't mean what he wrote as his father claims. Justin has been behind bars since March 27.
