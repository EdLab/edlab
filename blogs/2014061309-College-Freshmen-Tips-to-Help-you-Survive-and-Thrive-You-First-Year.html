            High school year is coming to an end for most seniors and they are excited about graduation. This is also a time where many of them begin to wonder about the next four years after high school. I just ended my first year in college and overall, it was a great experience. Here are some of the strategies I used that will might be of help to incoming college freshmen. There is an endless list of tips but I decided to share the most important ones. 
<ul>
<li>Get to know your roommate and others in your residence hall. They will be the people you will live with and share similar emotions and interests. The transition from high school to college is not easy, being social will make the transition easy. 
<li>Get organize. This is very important in college. In high school, most assignments were handed and done in class. However, in college it is completely different. You will only have a syllabus which will show the due date and description of all the assignments you will have to do over the semester. Sometimes the teachers will not remind you, so it's up to you to keep track of dates and make sure you are on top of everything.
<li>Go to class. In college, it is easier to skip class because you are free to do so. The professor will not tell you to go to class and the freedom of not having your parents on you back will push you to skip classes sometimes, especially 8AM classes. You will never realized how important it's to attend a class until you find yourself in the middle of an exam with you pen/pencil in your mouth asking yourself why you skipped the class. To avoid a failing grade, go to class.
<li>Meet your professor. Getting to know your professor will be very helpful. As a freshmen, Things will be confusing and sometimes you need someone to assist you, no one can assist better than your professor. He can help you will the course and even with others things that you might need such as recommendation and other, so take advantage of his/her office hours to ask any question you might have.
<li>Get to know your advisor.  Your advisor will be your best friend during your college journey. He will be helping you with many things such as, selecting major or minor, registering for classes, helping you in case of trouble with a professor, and also helping you how to drop and or add classes. He is person you turn to when you have any issue so take advantage of his aid. 
<li>Find the ideal place for you to study and be responsible of your actions. Some people like quietness and some like myself don't. However, you should you know what is best for you. The library is quiet place to study, it's included in your tuition so take advantage of it.  Be responsible and do not blame others for your actions, stay out of trouble. As a college student, you are no longer considered as a teenager, you are an adult so act like one.
<li>Get involve in campus. By getting involve in campus activities, you will feel like home, you will meet new people and become social because college after all, college about learning about yourself and others. College will be the most experimental or best time of your life. It's the time in which you get new experience and do new things and make discoveries about yourself and the world around you , so take advantage of it and make it worth.
</ul>
Take those college tips in consideration, they helped me and I am sure they will definitely help you also in the long run. I hope this help my high school seniors and I wish you all the best in college and beyond.
