CreateDebate.com, as the name implies, is an online debate forum for classrooms and organizations.  It currently supports three different types of debate: 1) two-sided debate, 2) 'popularity contest' debate which places the argument with the highest number of 'thumbs up' at the top and 3) 'challenge debate' which publicizes one-on-one debates for audience vote (or one can customize it to be only open to a smaller private community).  It also comes with 'grading tools' but I didn't get to try that particular feature.  To see its interesting pricing plans for classrooms or for an entire school, <a href="http://www.createdebate.com/about/pricing/school">check here</a>.

A much better description of the tool by Bryan Orme, the co-founder of CreateDebate:

<span style="font-weight:bold;">What is CreateDebate? How does it work? What are the underlying learning theories that support its application in the elearning space?</span>

CreateDebate in the Classroom enables teachers to customize and build an online debate community that can be easily incorporated into almost any lesson plan. Typically, teachers will create debates around questions that will build on the current course of study. The goal is to engage students and enrich the classroom conversation through peer collaboration. Debates can be conducted in the classroom “real-time” (if computers with Internet access are available) or participation can be assigned as homework and reviewed in class.

CreateDebate is built on Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, which states that when students are able to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate subjects they are learning at a much higher level than rote memorization of facts. CreateDebate is also based on James Surowiecki's theory of Collective Wisdom, which argues that the aggregation of information in groups leads to better conclusions and decisions. By engaging in collaborative debate, students are able to exchange ideas and theories that eventually lead to better conclusions than simply calling on the student that raises their hand.
