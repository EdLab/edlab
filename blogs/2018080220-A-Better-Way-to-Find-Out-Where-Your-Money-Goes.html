<p><a href="https://shapeapp.io/">Shape</a> is an app that aims to educate the newest generation of investors and traders, with a special focus on investing based on business’ ethical practices. Shape aims to teach users which companies are in line with their own values through themed searches, at-a-glance categorization, and more in-depth company profiles to help you make smart investing decisions.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Especially for millenials frightened by the 2008 financial crisis, investing can seem scary, and though Shape directly states that investing is risky, it does a good job of encouraging thoughtful investing based on knowledge of the facts. Shape organizes companies based on their contributions to ethical efforts, such as refugee support or LGBT+ rights, and then lets you build a watchlist or directly invest when you’re ready. Shape’s Learn function cleanly lays out the details of price targets, time horizons, risks, and diversification to introduce those with little prior trading knowledge to the basics of investing.</p> 

<p>Another great feature of Shape is that for many companies, you learn both the good and the bad. For example, while Exxon Mobile is registered as having pledged over $1 million in response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the app also informs you that the company has been accused of human rights violations in Aceh, Indonesia. This helps demystify the concept that ethics are black and white.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While companies are categorized based on what kinds of contributions and efforts they’ve made toward being ethical, the qualifications to be considered ethical are very general. For instance, to qualify as <i>giving</i> on the app, a company needs to have a founder who has signed the <a href="https://givingpledge.org/">Giving Pledge</a>, meaning they’ll donate at least half of their wealth to charitable causes. However, there is no information on what these charitable causes are.</p>

<p>In general, Shape could benefit from more comprehensive overviews of the companies featured. While you can of course go to a company’s website to answer specific questions, this takes you away from the app; a larger database of information would strengthen Shape.</p>

<p>While I like that criticism is included in company profiles, there could definitely be more of it, as I noticed a couple of company profiles failed to mention questionable decisions I knew had been made in the past.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Conceptually, Shape is a fantastic app, and though it could definitely be more detailed and comprehensive in its reviews of companies, it provides a great jumping off point for new investors to consider what their money is actually supporting.</p>
