<p>Despite extensive examination, the relationship between teachers’ pedagogical beliefs and their uses of technology in the classroom remains unclear. However, a review of a selection of global studies has revealed that a complex relationship exists between pedagogical beliefs and educational innovations, especially surrounding technology.</p>
 
<p>Beliefs serve as personal guides that help us define and understand the world and ourselves. But pedagogical beliefs refer specifically to the understandings, premises, or propositions about teaching and learning that we hold to be true. For the purpose of this study, researchers defined pedagogical beliefs as being specifically about teaching and learning. They applied a systematic review method to locate, critically evaluate, and synthesize 14 studies about the relationship between teachers’ pedagogical beliefs and their classroom uses of technology. The studies were conducted in eight countries: four in the United States, three in Singapore, two in Taiwan, one each in Belgium, the Netherlands, Israel, the United Kingdom, and Ireland.</p>
 
<p>The findings, reported in five synthesis statements, showed that programs aimed at increasing technology integration in education have often failed due to a mismatch between the educational change and the meanings attached to that change by teachers. The researchers recommend that the process of effective technology integration should not be facilitated as a stand-alone event, focusing solely on technical skills, and that teachers’ beliefs about "good" education should be a critical dimension in professional development programs that support teachers learning about the meaningful use of technology in education.</p>
