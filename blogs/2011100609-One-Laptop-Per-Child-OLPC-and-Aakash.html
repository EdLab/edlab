          <p>
            The Indian government <a href="http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/meet-aakash-indias-35-laptop/">claims</a> that it has now reached its $35 tablet PC, called Aakash, for students to use in areas where there is minimal access to education. I know I should be excited by this but there are a couple of problems I have with this announcement:

<b>Credibility</b>: When the Indian government first announced grand plans for super-cheap computers, what they considered a 'computer' seemed laughable. Not all of the details have rolled out, although 7' screen, 256 RAM, and Android 2.2 seems fine to me. Until the reviews come in, I cannot comment on the quality of technology at work here.

<b>Subsidization</b>: The laptops actually cost $50 but are being sold at $35. I guess they're hoping the traction this initial release gets will compensate for the losses they take. Yet it seems to me that the benefits of giving every little kid a laptop are questionable at best and come at severe cost when sold at a loss. The whole thing makes me uncomfortable.

<b>Distribution/business model</b>: It seems like the production and distribution model for Aakash is very similar to One-Laptop-Per-Child's model...which is not great news. OLPC made a lot of mistakes along the way and I still do not see why a deeply impoverished family would pony up $35 for a piece of hardware that is of questionable educational value. To get a better sense of where I come from on this issue, you will just have to see the bloggingheads-esque diavlog Fred and I will be posting today on OLPC
