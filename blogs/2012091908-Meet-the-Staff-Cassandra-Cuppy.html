            Returning  TC community members might have noticed a couple new faces at the  services desk in the last couple weeks. I’m one of those new faces!
<a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2012/09/caspic1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17113" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2012/09/caspic1.jpg" alt="Cassandra Cuppy" width="200" height="200" /></a>

My name is Cassandra Cuppy, I thought I’d let y’all know a little bit about me.

<strong>Where  I’m from:</strong> Most of my family lives in Kansas, where I spent my middle  school through college years there, so I usually tell people I’m from Kansas  City. However, I lived in Louisiana when I was little and moved back  there a few years ago - hence the use of the word y’all. I was living  New Orleans before I moved to New York City and it will always have a  special place in my heart.

<strong>My  educational and professional background: </strong>I hold a dual Bachelors of  Science degree in General Management and Marketing from Kansas State  University (located in Manhattan, Kansas). I was attending Louisiana  State University in pursuit of Masters in Library and Information  Science. I just transferred to Queens College this year to finish this  degree. I have worked in a university library for almost 4 years, first  as a student worker at KSU, then as a library associate at the  University of New Orleans.

<strong>Why  work in the library?: </strong>You may look at my background in business and  wonder how I ended up working at the Gottesman libraries and pursuing a  MLIS. Well, it all started with me finally getting an interview at my  undergraduate library. Like many students, I longed for an on-campus job  - better pay, flexible hours, the ability to do your homework on the  job. I had applied to the library a number of times and finally got an  interview my fourth year. And then got the job! And learned a couple  things pretty quickly - one, depending on what time a day you work, you  can’t do your homework. Two, I finally found a job I enjoyed and  something I could imagine doing as a career - something I never quite  felt in my business classes. I never imagined I could make a job out of my love for books. Plus, I found that I loved having people find the books they  needed for class or showing them that we had DVDs they could check out  for fun. And the people I worked with were amazing - smart, funny and geeky. We could  bound over our favorite books or argue about the merits of latest popular series.

I  also learned that there are different levels of employment within the  library and I could look for jobs after getting my Bachelors without  having to get my Masters right away. When I finished college, that’s  exactly what I did at the University of New Orleans. And now here at the  Teachers College.

I  still get a rush from knowing I can help students with everything from  the routine, like how to print to the complex, like how to utilize our  electronic databases to get started on a dissertation.

<strong>Fun Facts about me:</strong>
<strong>Favorite  book</strong>: As a library school student and library employee, I get this  question a lot and it is HARD to answer. It changes a lot, based my  mood, what book I’m reading at the moment and a host of other factors.  Some of my favorites include any book by <a title="Vonnegut" href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search~S6?/avonnegut/avonnegut/1%2C2%2C5%2CB/exact&amp;FF=avonnegut+kurt&amp;1%2C4%2C/indexsort=-" target="_blank">Kurt Vonnegut</a> or Douglas Adams.  My favorites in the last year or two have been <a title="Hunger Games at TC" href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search~S6?/Xhunger+games&amp;SORT=D&amp;searchscope=6/Xhunger+games&amp;SORT=D&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SUBKEY=hunger+games/1%2C7%2C7%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=Xhunger+games&amp;SORT=D&amp;searchscope=6&amp;1%2C1%2C" target="_blank">The Hunger Games</a>, <a title="Divergent - TC" href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search~S6?/XDivergent&amp;SORT=D&amp;searchscope=6/XDivergent&amp;SORT=D&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SUBKEY=Divergent/1%2C171%2C171%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=XDivergent&amp;SORT=D&amp;searchscope=6&amp;1%2C1%2C" target="_blank">Divergent </a>by Veronica Roth and Incarnate by Jodi Meadows. Find me on Goodreads for more!

<strong>Favorite  food</strong>: Again, hard to answer, because I love trying new foods and  restaurants. My boyfriend’s slow-cooked short ribs with polenta are high  on my list, as well as chicken tikka marsala and lamb korma. I also  love chocolate, especially cupcakes.

<strong>Favorite  things about moving to New York</strong>: I have only lived in New York for four  months now, so I still finding my favorite places, but there are things  I’m liking about it, including:
<ul>
	<li>The ability to get any type of food from any ethnicity</li>
	<li>Good bagels</li>
	<li>The Waffle and Dingles cart - Strawberries and Nutella</li>
	<li>Stand-up comedy (seriously, I love stand-up!)</li>
	<li>Broadway and Off Broadway</li>
	<li>Central Park</li>
</ul>
<strong>Random  other things to know about me:</strong> I love Doctor Who. (We have an eBook about the show <a title="Doctor Who ebrary" href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search~S6?/XDoctor+Who&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SORT=DZ/XDoctor+Who&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;extended=0&amp;SUBKEY=Doctor+Who/1%2C144%2C144%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=XDoctor+Who&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;1%2C1%2C/indexsort=-" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="Doctor Who2 - ebrary" href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search~S6?/XDoctor+Who&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SORT=DZ/XDoctor+Who&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;extended=0&amp;SUBKEY=Doctor+Who/1%2C144%2C144%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=XDoctor+Who&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;3%2C3%2C/indexsort=-" target="_blank">here</a>)I’m also a pretty big  nerd about a lot of other things - Joss Whedon shows (learn about them <a title="Joss Whedon - ebrary" href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search~S6?/XJoss+whedon&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SORT=DZ/XJoss+whedon&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;extended=0&amp;SUBKEY=Joss+whedon/1%2C4%2C4%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=XJoss+whedon&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;2%2C2%2C/indexsort=-" target="_blank">here</a>) Star Wars (eBook <a title="Star Wars eBook" href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search~S6?/Xstar+wars&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SORT=DZ/Xstar+wars&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;extended=0&amp;SUBKEY=star+wars/1%2C13%2C13%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=Xstar+wars&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;1%2C1%2C/indexsort=-" target="_blank">here</a>), Star  Trek (eBook <a title="Star Trek ebrary" href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search~S6?/Xstar+trek&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SORT=DZ/Xstar+trek&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;extended=0&amp;SUBKEY=star+trek/1%2C7%2C7%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=Xstar+trek&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;1%2C1%2C/indexsort=-" target="_blank">here</a>). For my fun, non-class reading, I read almost nothing besides Young  Adult novels. The best thing is when my class reading is Young Adult  novels, which happened last year in library school. :)

I’m  really excited to be a part of the services team. Stop by the library  any time you need help or if you want to talk about the newest Doctor  Who episode or express your frustration that third book of your favorite  YA series isn’t coming out until late 2013.
