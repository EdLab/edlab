<p>Designed for students in grades 6-8, <a href="https://www.glasslabgames.org/games/SC/">SimCityEDU</a>consists of four separate challenges for learners to complete. The player acts as a city mayor, responsible for maintaining the happiness and health of citizens. Each city has a particular environment-related problem that the mayor must address. Students need to find ways to get kids to school, create jobs, and replace current energy systems with clean alternatives. With a limited budget and a time constraint, players must think critically about a number of factors before they implement their solutions and submit their work.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The game is easily accessible on the website, and is free to download and play. Each of the four challenges is independent of the others, so there is no need to save game progress. SimCityEDU is a great opportunity for student collaboration, as small groups or pairs can brainstorm together to work through the challenges. The scenarios that players face are relevant to real and current conundrums within society, pushing users to consider solutions for problems affecting both the fictional inhabitants of SimCityEDU and real people in the world.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>When first starting out and trying to determine how to play, there is not much in-game guidance. Teachers may need to allot additional time during class to introduce students to the software. The other drawback is that an optional feature, which allows teachers to track student performance via game progress reports, requires a yearly fee to upgrade the teacher’s account.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Teachers who are experimenting with civics and social studies educational gaming should check out SimCityEDU with their students. The tool feels more like a game than an assignment, yet still stimulates thought. This is perhaps the <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/2592">most effective quality</a> of game-based learning. Students’ critical thinking and reasoning are fostered, two valuable capabilities which transcend discipline and are essential to every field of study. Keeping students engaged and entertained while they build such skills? That’s the icing on the cake.</p>
