<p>Eighteen years ago, the most exciting piece of technology in my life was the car phone in my mom’s minivan. Today, I flit between my smartphone, tablet, work computer, and personal laptop. Most of us are perpetually connected to at least one digital device at all times, though more likely it’s two or three. While digital connectivity visibly affects our social and work lives, it might also affect our cognitive abilities.</p>
 
<p>New research examined the connection between everyday computer and smartphone usage behavior and two mental capabilities: sustained attention and cognitive reflection, or rational thinking. In particular, researchers observed how the number of hours spent computing each day and the device used impacted these cognitive functions. The participants ranged in age from 18–76 years old.</p>
 
<p>The researchers found a direct negative relationship between hours spent computing each day and both cognitive abilities. In other words, the more hours a person spent on a computer each day, the lower they scored on sustained attention and rational thinking tests. In addition, people who chose to use their smartphones for most of their computing had even lower scores on the rational thinking tests.</p>
 
<p>Of course, these results need not cause panic among the perpetually connected. The study also indicates that adults who interact with computers daily tend to have greater measures of executive functioning than those who do not. And clearly, it is possible to practice sustained attention when working on a computer for long periods of time. Yet this study shows an overall trend that could affect the trajectory of society at large. As we grow increasingly connected to devices, particularly smartphones, our ability to pay attention for long periods of time and think rationally could decrease.</p>
 
<p>The researchers suggest ways to counteract the negative implications they identify. Namely, limit computer and smartphone use to essential tasks and choose non-digital activities more frequently for entertainment. Although this was much easier to do in the long gone days of the minivan car phone, this study could still be put to use in daily life. If I can improve my attention and rational thinking abilities by spending less time on my phone each day, I think it’s worth the handful of fewer Buzzfeed posts I would peruse.</p>
