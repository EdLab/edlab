The emerging library: Structure, culture, and lessons learned from the dissolution of a combined librariesâ€”IT organization. <i>Journal of Library Administration, 52</i>(1), 147-161.</a> 

In 1997 the University of Southern California's libraries joined campus technology to become the USC Information Services Division. The merge was part of a growing, largely librarian-motivated trend to hitch libraries to the accelerating wagon of personal computing and internet usage. In 2006 the two entities went their separate ways, the digital information landscape had become roomy enough for both organizations to exist side-by-side. The first shake out of the library staff in 2007 revealed a hearty enthusiasm for the re-emerging space, staff identified over 200 action points towards providing better library service. The transition team organized these into 14 overall objectives which became the 2008-2009 strategic plan for the library. 

One of the difficulties they faced as a re-emerging library, was dealing with the way reference has changed since 1997. Used to providing largely asynchronous, remote tech support, the libraries held a view of reference that was almost too progressive and failed to meet student expectations for library service. The 2009-2010 strategic plan called for more consistent training and staffing in these areas and the academic year saw a 72% increase in reference transactions. The library also worked to address inconsistencies in the catalog, create more fulfilling work for student staff members, and did extensive inventorying and weeding. The library conducted annual use surveys during this time to chart progress and identify weak areas. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
One of the most interesting features of the reorganization was a move from a flat structure, with many direct reports to few managers in the Information Services Division, to an extremely hierarchical structure in the reformed library. The new organizational structure featured a dean, the senior associate dean, three associate deans (public services, collections, and information technology) and two executive directors with head librarians of each branch library and each discipline. The library also established 6-person committees around each of the 14 objectives in their initial strategic plan. 

The structural change seems primarily motivated by organizational concerns, the USC system is very large and was so flat in its former incarnation that it seemed to stifle idea communication and smother change initiatives in the organization. Another motivating factor may have been the attitudes revealed in the initial survey around non-librarians in branch management positions. Librarian supremacy aside, USC's reinvention seems a best practice in enthusiasm, evaluation, and change.
