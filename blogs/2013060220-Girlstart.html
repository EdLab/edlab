<i>Girlstart develops and implements a range of innovative, research-based education and mentorship programs designed to promote girls’ early engagement and academic success in STEM, encourage postsecondary aspirations and persistence in the STEM pipeline among women and other underrepresented groups, and develop a diverse STEM workforce for the 21st century</i> (<a href= "http://www.girlstart.org/">Girlstart site</a>).

<p>
<b>Creating a STEM-pede!</b><br>
While there are many new initiatives aimed at encouraging young women to enter and engage with STEM subjects (<a href="http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/smart-takes/google-supports-female-students-in-stem-subjects/22492">Google’s "Mind the Gap!"</a> initiative and <a href="http://girldevelopit.com/">Girl Develop It</a> to name a few), Central Texas-based <a href="http://www.girlstart.org/">Girlstart</a> stands out as one of the oldest (started in 1997), largest (has served over 30K young girls) and most comprehensive (includes BOTH primary and secondary grades).  Running casual learning camps, afterschool programs, and workshops to encourage young girls to engage in STEM subjects, the group is working to help inspire and engage young women in subjects that have been historically dominated by those with XY chromosomes.  
<p>
Over the last few years US boys have become slightly better represented in STEM fields (though not nearly enough to meet the <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Encouraging-STEM-Students-Is/132425/">growing demand worldwide</a>), while their female peers (despite earning more college degrees on the whole) <a href="http://today.ucla.edu/portal/ut/q-a-linda-sax-on-the-stem-gap-241852.aspx">continue to fall farther and farther behind in STEM-heavy subjects</a>.  Girlstart hopes to create a veritable STEM-pede of STEM interest and learning by hosting hands-on Girlstart initiatives that, "...foster 1st through 8th grade girls’ interest and confidence in STEM by immersing girls in hands-on activities and introducing them to positive female role-models in these areas."  Not only does Girlstart hope to engage girls through mentorship, but also through the breadth and depth of the subjects covered by the program.  Going beyond the Girl Scout’s "<a href="http://forgirls.girlscouts.org/home/badgeexplorer/#flowers">Flowers badge</a>", Girlstart starts girls down the path to real understanding in fields like robotics, physics, and even advanced HTML.  Cookies not included. 
<p>
<b>SySTEMic, same-sex change</b><br>
Girlstart workshops are not limited to student participation; instead, the program offers opportunities for young learners, educators, and/or caregivers to gain insight into STEM subject matter as well as the "how’s" and "why’s" of engaging this unique population of learners.  Extensive research is being done by groups that include the aforementioned <a href="http://www.girlscouts.org/research/pdf/generation_stem_full_report.pdf">Girl Scouts</a> as well as researchers like <a href="http://today.ucla.edu/portal/ut/q-a-linda-sax-on-the-stem-gap-241852.aspx">UCLA Education Professor, Linda Sax</a>, that will help to shed light on how and why girls are attracted to certain subjects and perform with <a href="http://www.singlesexschools.org/research-singlesexvscoed.htm">more proficiency in single-sex STEM classes</a>.  Girlstart attempts to harness this research by providing learners whose families are often unable to afford private, single-sex schools and costly, formal after-school opportunities with opportunities for enrichment (<a href="http://www.girlstart.org/support-girlstart/sendagirltocamp#sampletweets">#sendagirltocamp campaign</a>).  
<p>
Thanks to the <a href="http://www.titleix.info/">Title IX advances</a> of the last 40 years girls in US schools are not (usually) openly discriminated against based on sex. However, this discrimination occurs in <a href="http://www.aaup.org/article/why-are-we-still-worried-about-women-science#.USKbiVriqmA">other subtle and not-so subtle ways (Google Lawrence Summers, then Harvard president’s infamous commencement comments)</a>.  However, to ignore the overwhelming evidence that women are being left out of the STEM equation (whether inadvertently or not) would be tantamount to a Title IX breach of fairness.  
<p>
What is it exactly that is leaving our women and girls behind in the STEM dust of their male peers?  When will women, who are often heads of households, have a chance to earn more than merit badges and instead compete on equal footing with their male peers in the science trenches and be eligible for the <a href="http://www.careerpath.com/career-advice/STEM-jobs-high-pay-fast-growth-but-women-needed/">financial gains that STEM careers afford</a>?  Until we have more answers and viable possible solutions, initiatives like Girlstart are just that... a start. 
<p>
<b>Exclusive NLT interview with GirlStart Executive Director, Tamara Hudgins, Ph.D.</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How is the Girlstart program unique in the effort to inspire and educate young women re: STEM subjects?<br>  
<b>Answer:</b> Girlstart is a standalone nonprofit organization solely dedicated to STEM education for girls. We do year-round STEM educational programming that is standards-and research based, and is designed to empower, equip, and inspire girls to sustain engagement in STEM. We believe that we are unique for these reasons. Girlstart is solely dedicated to STEM education for girls. Everything we do is oriented towards that mission. Other organizations are either programs of larger entities (such as museums, universities, or larger institutional nonprofits) which means that they can be eliminated as fancy turns to the next shiny object in education. Other organizations tend to concentrate on after school programming or summer programming; we focus equally on these two important opportunities to reach and engage girls (in addition to the other types of programming that we do). 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Why are single-sex STEM educational opportunities important? <br>
<b>Answer:</b> Single-gender STEM educational opportunities are vital because girls are encouraged to take risks, which promotes active learning. What we see is that in mixed-gender environments girls will let the boys 'drive' and they will take a diminished role. This is not because they have fewer skills than the boys, but that their understanding about how to solve the problem is different. By eliminating that element, girls are free to explore, engage, and learn together. They feel that it is okay to take risks and go on a journey together. And, because women represent just under 25% of the nation's STEM workforce, and STEM careers are far more stable and rewarding than non-STEM careers, we all have a vested interest in seeing girls become strong, independent women who can sustain themselves. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are the main barriers that young women face to careers in STEM fields? <br>
<b>Answer:</b> The main barriers include, but are not limited to: lack of meaningful engagement with STEM; access to a variety of female role models (women who work in STEM fields); encouragement with regard to staying in STEM subjects and electives. But there are a lot of reasons ranging from the limited ability of formal educational environments to engage children (regardless of gender) in STEM, to limited access that families have to meaningful out of school time experiences, as well as limited community resources (such as science centers or museums).
<p>
<b>Question: </b>Why is it particularly important to include parents and educators in your program?  What unique resources do you offer to them? <br>
<b>Answer:</b> If we are going to get to the dinner table--which is our goal, to get to the dinner table, or the car, as a point of conversation--we have to provide resources to parents so that they can see why STEM education is important. If we are going to be able to change the conversation about what girls can, and should do, with their lives, we have to include parents in that conversation. Girlstart After School includes a parent component for precisely this reason. We have a Girlstart Parent Association that meets in Austin every month, and activities range from talks about STEM in the workforce to trips to visit college campuses. For teachers, we provide professional development in skills building areas, such as underwater robotics, but we also do generalist TPD that encourages informal practice in the classroom. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are the unique challenges for a program that works outside of the traditional school day?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> One challenge is that because we are informal and OST, we are considered less important or impactful than formal learning. We strenuously disagree with this assumption. Because K-12 children spend LESS than 20 percent of their waking hours in formal learning environments, we have got to find more ways to support more informal learning programs--because without these types of programs, children are losing an exceptional opportunity to learn and grow. 
<p>
<b>Question: </b>How do you develop your curriculum?<br> 
<b>Answer:</b> We develop our Girlstart After School curriculum to reflect the scope and cadence of learning that happens in Texas schools, which typically establish what types of activities a student will be doing in any given week. Because we care about increasing grades and test scores in science through Girlstart After School, we try to develop new and engaging informal activities that complement the types of learning that students are doing in a given semester (earth science and engineering, in the main). We do, of course, also include some of the fun activities (such as video game development) in our Girlstart After School program that we typically do at Girlstart Summer Camp, but that is because we love blending the technology-rich experiences that we do at Camp with the after school program. 
<p>
For Girlstart Summer Camp, it starts with a theme. We do four to six different themes each summer. And we toss in activities that we love, and a lot that are new to us, and we ask questions that are related to that theme. Each Summer Camp we ensure that girls make a fully playable video game, and have technology experiences such as robotics, computer programming, and 3D printing. This coming summer we will include app development. We have fun developing our ideas, then we work together as well as with curriculum developers (because all our work is standards based) to ensure that we are maintaining a consistent program that delivers results.
