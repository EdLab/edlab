<p><b>Title:</b> Analyzing the Flow of Knowledge in Computer Mediated Teams (2013)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Joshua E. Introne & Marcus Drescher</p>


<p><b>Study Design:</b>
The authors of <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2441816">Analyzing the Flow of Knowledge in Computer Mediated Teams</a> sought to examine the historical evolution of knowledge as it flows across an online discussion community. To this end, they developed and tested a strategy called Topic Evolution Analysis (TEvA), which tracks clusters of words in conversation and illustrates how these clusters change and merge over time. TEvAâ€™s algorithm parses conversations and filters out connecting words to identify important keywords. The keywords are then mapped onto nodes that visualize which words are used together, the transfer of words from one person to another, and the use of words over time. The assumption in this algorithm is that the most recent version of each historical topic is a viable current topic.</p> 

<p>The authors then developed an integrated collaborative intensity index to measure the construction of knowledge within the group. The index measures the spread of activity across team members, the posting speed, and participation level of the group members involved in the conversation. In the lab study, they recruited 20 five-member teams who generated 1,200 discussion posts. The task of the teams was to collaboratively identify the correct suspect in a fictional murder mystery story. Half of the discussion posts were mediated with TEvA and half were not. The results from TEvA were contrasted with two known topic-modeling algorithms (LDA & CTM), and compared to manual topic assignments to validate the algorithm effectiveness. TEvA demonstrated that it is an effective method for extracting psychologically meaningful topics from the corpus and was significantly more similar to the manual coding than the other two established algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The authors found that, in group discussions, high topic convergence and high collaborative intensity were strongly correlated. This seems to indicate that when group members were attempting to combine their information and develop a story, they collaborated frequently and their language was well-aligned. The shared story became more important than the individual pieces of evidence and groups were likely to discount evidence that did not fit within an emerging consensual story or infer evidence that completed the story. Such findings suggest that story formation could be a natural part of decision making for groups if they are allowed to manage their own decision process. It did not appear that groups were choosing the best individually-created story but rather, group members actively sought to construct a collaborative story through discussion. The representational support for both narratives and argument structures allowed collaborators to remain within the formation and decision making process.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
Through visualizing knowledge flow, we can interpret the movement of information within a group and better understand how groups deviate from rationality. This study revealed that collaborative storytelling is very important to group discussion, perhaps even more important than finding the correct answer. Collaboration is often necessary in education and modeling systems like the one tested in this publication to help learners to understand how they reach consensus and better identify problems in group dynamics. The development of more accurate algorithms might enable realtime discussion analysis, which could help collaborators recognize and overcome bias and lead to improved teamwork.</p>
