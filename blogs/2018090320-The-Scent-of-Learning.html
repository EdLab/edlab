<p>Recent educational research suggests that learning games can improve student engagement and knowledge acquisition. However, digital learning games typically include only audio and visual elements. Because neuroscience studies indicate that engaging multiple senses enhances learning, these researchers designed a digital learning game that incorporates scents to test whether the addition of smell improves knowledge acquisition and overall enjoyment.</p>
 
<p>In the study, 117 junior high students in Taiwan played Fragrance Channel, a digital game designed by the researchers to teach students about spice trading during the 17th-century Age of Exploration. In the game, players impersonate European explorers and sail around the world to trade and battle for spices. Half the students played the PC version of the game, and half used mobile devices. Within both groups, some students played a version of the game that included smelling spices before trading, and others played the game without the accompanying scents.</p>
 
<p>To measure their knowledge acquisition, all of the students completed a test about the Age of Exploration before and immediately after playing the game. The four groups showed almost equal knowledge increase, indicating that neither the presence of smells nor the digital format of the game significantly impacted learning outcomes. However, students who played the game with smells were also asked to complete a survey reporting how the fragrances affected their experience. These users reported that the presence of smells improved both their understanding of concepts and their enjoyment.</p>
 
<p>Although incorporating smells in this digital game did not increase knowledge acquisition, the students’ positive perception of the scents’ impact on learning and enjoyment suggests the promise of multi-sensory games in education.</p>
