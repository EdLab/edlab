I know that the continuing struggle between publishers of e-content and academic library e-reserves wranglers probably doesn't keep you up at night, but I've been riding that long and lonely plain and find the subject applicable and rather scintillating. I'll try to tart it up a bit for your reading pleasure. 

<b>Description:</b>
E-reserves are a tricky business. Many subscription systems rely on persistent links to create searchless course reserves for students. <i>Harvard Business Review</i> was one of the first journals to yank the persistent link to prevent e-reserves sharing. To go about this, HBR removed access through EBSCO databases but offered several institutions access for an additional fee. I was wondering why I haven't had a problem with this, but it seems Columbia accepted the terms through EBSCO. The problem lies in subscription terms, many specify that articles accessed are for personal research only. While this doesn't exclude classroom linking, it provides a platform with which to re-charge libraries that want to provide a comprehensive e-reserves service. 

It is a bit scary that EBSCO is poised with these persistent links that they could yank at any time, but scarier still is the drawn-out reckoning <a href="http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6552021.html">Georgia State University</a> is getting for fair use misuse. That said, the author's closing statements seem a bit outdated, “The higher mission of HBR and other academic journals is to share research and knowledge so it can be used to further more research and knowledge.” Perhaps I'm internet jaded, but I think that's sort of <i>our</i> higher mission. Until they make us stop, we can keep providing good and copious information to our communities in whatever fair use-ish way we can. In other words, we've got to keep on keeping on:

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
DocDel has a pretty hearty linking system that eats almost anything and the Columbia/TC subscription network offers a bountiful feast of electronic resources. With a homecooked system, we don't necessarily need to worry about individual publishers attempting to thwart access. We should, however, keep a weather eye to the results of the Georgia State University case, fair use in e-reserves could be in for a change.
