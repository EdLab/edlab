          <p>
            With HTML5 being implemented and discussed more and more (<a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=HTML5">see this google trends query</a>) and with Gary's post about <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/4144">HTML5 vs The App Store</a> I thought I would share some resources I have found helpful in learning about what I can and cannot do with HTML5 as a web developer. I think it is also helpful to understand what is meant by HTML5 as the "flash killer" or "app killer".

<!--break-->

The best resource hands down that I know of is Mark Pilgrim's <a href="http://diveintohtml5.com/">Dive Into HTML5</a>. This is a thorough and informative online book about the history, future, and applications of HTML5. Pilgrim does a great job explaining how HTML5 came into existence and why it supplanted XHMTL, the short answer in Linchpin terms is that the HTML5 team shipped.
 
Another excellent and informative resource is <a href="http://apirocks.com/html5/html5.html#slide1">this slideshow presentation about HTML5 created with HTML5</a>. This presentation clearly gets at the point that HTML5 is not really just about HTML5 but instead about HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. The combination of those three technologies gets to the crux of why people think HTML5 is such an innovative step forward for web standards.

The main resons HTML5 is getting a lot of press is the "flash killer" and "app killer" arguments. These arguments are really based upon the new video, audio, and canvas elements. Canvas especially has opened up new possibilities for creating dynamic and interactive sites and games online using only Javascript, CSS, and HTML5. Some of the best examples can be seen at the <a href="http://www.chromeexperiments.com/">Chrome Experiments</a> site. These are a series of Javascript games and artworks made to showcase the Chrome browser's capabilities.

Since this post is getting a bit long I will leave it at that. I will also say I am very excited about the future of web dev because of HTML5 but don't feel we are even close to a world where it will reign supreme on the desktop or on mobile browsers. If you are interested in more HTML5 talk I would love to chat about ideas, possibilites, and limitations.
