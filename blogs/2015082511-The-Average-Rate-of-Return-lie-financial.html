Following on today's D & R, I just thought I'd share just one way in which the marketing literature in most funds (mutual or even venture for that matter) can be misleading. And this is the infamous *average rate of return*.

Let's say I become a fund manager and I say I have an average rate of return of 10%. Now, what are you going to think? You would think (assuming the interest is simple) that if you interest $100 today, in about a year's time you will have $110. Right? Wrong. What if I were to tell you, you would get $98 back. So, you lost $2 instead of making $10, as you thought you would. You'd be shocked right? Well that's exactly what's happening and here is how.

Let's the price of stock X is $100 today. It falls by 30% -- so it's new price is $70. And then, it goes up by 40% -- so the new price is $98 ( 70 + 70 * 0.4). The *average rate of return* is 10%(-30 + 40).

This is just one of the many ways that mutual funds (that are provided by most 401ks) can mislead you. I'm not saying all are bad, but if there is one piece of financial advice I can give with no disclaimer and know that works, it would be to develop a basic understanding of financial jargon and educating one's self.
