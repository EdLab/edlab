            This virtual handout is intended as an overview of library resources and services of particular relevance for students in  Suzanne Pratt's Fall 2014 course <em>C&amp;T 4502, Master's Project</em>. The resources, primarily electronic and accessible on and off campus,  have been selected as ones supporting the objectives of the course,  i.e., to facilitate "the organization and completion of the independent  research project, which is a requirement for the M.A. degree in New York  State."   This blog post also includes a section describing research  consultation and assistance services and options for document retrieval  and delivery available to all members of the Teachers College community.
