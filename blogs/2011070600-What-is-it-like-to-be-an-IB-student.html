            The International Baccalaureate (IB) which was formerly known as the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) is an international educational foundation. IB was founded in 1968 in Geneva and it offers three educational programs for ages 3-19. Diploma or certificates is awarded at the end of the diploma program.The IB has recently reached a historic milestone of 4000 IB programs worldwide and there are more than 900,000 IB students in over 140 countries.

Knowledge And Power Preparatory Academy(KAPPA) is one of the few schools in New York or the Bronx precisely who offer the IB program. The most popular advanced classes most schools have are the Advanced Placement (AP) courses.  I am privileged to be one of 30 out of 90 students in my grade currently enrolled in the IB program. It is a very rigorous course but it offers high quality programs in international education. To be an IB student requires a lot of hard work and dedication as well as a good work ethic. Once you fall behind at any particular point during the course of the year, it is difficult to get back on track.  For every IB class, you are required to write a research paper about either a personal topic or an assigned book or particular topic which must be no less than five pages while others require 10. Even though I play competitive travel soccer in addition to other school and church related activities, I spend a great deal of my time researching projects or going through my coursework to keep the information fresh. As a rising high school senior, being in the IB program increases my chances of hopefully gaining admittance to several of my college choices (Columbia, Stanford, Stony Brook, etc). In some instances, colleges may wave your entire freshman first year off if a student has the IB Diploma.

IB is very challenging because most of the courses and assignments are mostly college level. Also, many of the papers and assignments we complete are sent off to many different countries for them to be graded by professionals who have excelled in the program themselves and thus grading can be very harsh sometimes. Even though the IB program is very challenging, I would recommend the IB program to any student looking to take college level courses as it would challenge them more and most importantly get them ready for college.
