Several years ago, motivated by a lifelong interest in global economic development, I decided to enroll in a mooc offered by Columbia University professor Jeffrey Sachs on Coursera. The course, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/sustainable-development">The Age of Sustainable Development</a>, was highly publicized by Sachs and Coursera. Sachs claimed that over a million people enrolled in the course. This was driven in part by Sachs’ celebrity as one of the foremost economists in the world and <em>the expert</em> on economic development.

I first became familiar with Sachs’ work when I read his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/End-Poverty-Economic-Possibilities-Time/dp/0143036580">The End of Poverty</a>, for a global inequality course I took in college. I enrolled in the mooc with no major expectations. I simply wanted to learn more about sustainable development and if there were any new exciting or emerging trends in this area. Sustainable development is one of those buzz words you often hear when it comes to improving lives in developing countries. I did some prep work for the course by revisiting relevant resources from my college classes and textbooks (yes I still have them).

After three weeks, I quit the course. At the time, I simply felt I was not learning any new material and I was often bored or uninterested when I looked at the course materials. Upon reflection after three years, here are the main reasons I didn’t finish the course:
<ul>
	<li>The format of the course included a 10-15 lecture from Sachs and some corresponding materials. I learned best by doing and applying what I am learning. Listening to Sachs talk/narrate a video felt too much like I was back in college listening to a boring lecture.</li>
	<li>Since I came into the course with a solid background on the major issues affecting developing countries, the initial topics and touching points were not new and thus I lost interest in the content early. I took the course to learn something new or interesting about sustainable development. I got neither.</li>
</ul>
In the end, I stopped the course early because I knew I was not going to learn anything. I felt it would be futile and a complete waste of time for me to continue the course.
