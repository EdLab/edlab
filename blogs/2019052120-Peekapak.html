<p><a href="https://www.peekapak.com/">Peekapak’s</a> mission is to help children become successful, compassionate, caring, and empathetic citizens of the world. To achieve this lofty goal, co-founders Ami Shah and Angie Chan created a platform that combines social-emotional classroom learning with at-home lessons and interactive games. Their evidence-based program integrates social-emotional learning with both fun games and academic standards, and encourages a partnership between teachers and parents. The platform is mostly marketed to schools and school districts, but is available to homeschoolers as well. A 30-day trial allows educators to try out the product before purchase.</p>

<p>Each of Peekapak’s ten lessons focuses on a different social-emotional skill such as self-regulation, respect, gratitude, or empathy. Each lesson features a digital storybook about the adventures of the inhabitants of Peekaville that is available in both English and Spanish. The curriculum is available for pre-k through third grade and includes differentiation tips for adjusting difficulty level and for meeting the needs of English Language Learners. At the beginning of the first lesson, students receive a letter from Leo the Hedgehog. In the accompanying story, they are introduced to Leo’s classmates as he navigates the first day of school. Every classroom lesson is supplemented with a home activity, which teachers can email to parents through the Peekapak website. The website also contains a game portal called myPeekaville in which students can explore Peekaville, complete quests, and play minigames. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Peekapak is an easy-to-use resource for teachers. The lesson plans are clear and thorough, and each includes notes aligning the lesson with supporting research and English Language Arts Common Core grade standards. The platform includes details that make teachers’ lives easier, such as including templates for parent emails, offering detailed outlines for guiding students through activities, and enabling teachers to send home updates through the Peekapak website. Peekapak is designed to fit into existing curricula, eliminating the need for teachers to add social-emotional learning on top of existing lessons. Instead of learning to read and learning self-regulation separately, students in a Peekapak class can learn to read by engaging with the story about self-regulation.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most distinguishing aspect of Peekapak is its emphasis on parental involvement. The platform is free and accessible to parents, and the curriculum offers parents clear instructions for how to compliment classroom learning at home. The creators of Peekapak seem to understand that life outside school affects social-emotional learning as much, if not more, than classroom education, and I applaud them for supporting parents in their role as educators.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While Peekapak offers a thorough and complete curriculum, a few technical errors surfaced during my engagement with its online game world. In contrast with the ultra-intuitive lesson plans, I found my Peekaville difficult to navigate. It took me a while to figure out where to find minigames and how to purchase new accessories for my avatar. Additionally, there was a mismatch between the audio and the writing in a few games. For example, the writing on every tag on the Tree of Gratitude read "Grateful for rain," but the audio pronounced different options of things for which to be thankful. While these errors are small and do not affect content, because they are on the game platform, they could be easily discovered by parents. I hope that Peekapak works to fix these bugs so as to not risk giving parents the wrong impression about what is, in reality, a carefully developed learning tool.</p>

 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Peekapak is an impressively researched, thoroughly developed curriculum that highlights the importance of school-home collaboration for effective social-emotional learning.</p>
