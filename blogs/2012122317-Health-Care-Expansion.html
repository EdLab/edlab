          <p>
             The signing of the Affordable Care Act by President Obama is the most influential health care reform since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid. It brings us a step closer to having universal health care coverage for every American. The law will provide coverage for an estimated 30 million people, reduce the overall cost of health care and ensure the delivery of quality health care. However, there remains millions, including undocumented immigrants, who will be left uninsured when the law goes into effect.
<p> 
The new legislation will expand Medicaid eligibility by giving access to low income individuals and families who are below 133% of the federal poverty level. This means an additional 15 million people will be covered according to the Department of Health. The Affordable Care Act will reduce premium and provide tax relief and credits to individuals and small businesses that provide health insurance for their employees. The law will also provide a wide range of options so that people can purchase affordable coverage in a competitive insurance market. In spite of these positive aspects, the law will not be able to cover every single individual in the country. For example, people who are unemployed and cannot receive coverage, low income people who are eligible for Medicaid but do not enroll, either because they have no knowledge or are intimidated by the long application process and illegal immigrants will not be covered under this law. Moreover with the recent tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut, many are questioning the strength of our health care system in how it reaches out to support the mentally ill and other disorders.
