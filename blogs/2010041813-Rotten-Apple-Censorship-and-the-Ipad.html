In an era when so many seem so willing to sacrifice fundamental rights of a free society for the false premises of security or the vague promises of progress, perhaps it is not surprising that so little attention has been devoted to the growing influence of distribution channels on the flow of information that shapes general perceptions.  Thus it is particularly notable that some are calling attention to the censorship regime that appears to govern the Apple app store.   <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/17/books/17cartoonist.html?hpw">This account</a> in the NY Times highlights how Apple rejected an application from a cartoonist whose work challenged established authority until the work of this cartoonist won a Pulitzer Prize. This issue is explored further<a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/its_time_for_the_press_to_push.php"> in the CJR </a>.  Note the dissenting comments on the main article that dismiss the concerns being raised. 

The implications for educators seem as important as those for journalists.  Despite the claims of the large technology providers (Apple, Google, etc.) that they are only providers of tools, they are, in fact, becoming important mediators in the distribution of content.  This means that educators must recognize that working with the distribution tools (e.g., app store, itunes U, YouTube, etc.) means entering into a relationship very much like those previously had with publishers. Educators using these platforms are giving up some degree of control to their publishing partners, and it is important to understand these new partners and the values they represent.  This does not mean that educators should not enter into such arrangements anymore than it means they should refrain from working with traditional publishers.  It just means that educators have an obligation to understand the arrangements that will govern their work in the context of the new channels.
