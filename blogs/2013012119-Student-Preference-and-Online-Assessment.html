<b>Title:</b> Can Online Course-Based Assessment Methods be Fair and Equitable? Relationships Between Studentsâ€™ Preferences and Performance Within Online and Offline Assessments (2012)<p>
<b>Author:</b> Claire Hewson
</p>


<p><b>Study Design:</b> Computer grading and submissions can do a lot for teachers and students in hybrid courses. Entrusting assignments to a learning management system reduces human error and helps organize and track document exchange between teachers and students. Electronic document exchange seems like a no-brainer to the tech savvy, but some users may have access issues or opinions that cause them to prefer traditional methods. The solution for many programs is to hybridize submissions, accepting student work both physically and electronically, though this compromise sometimes seems like the worst of both worlds. <i>Can Online Course-Based Assessment Methods be Fair and Equitable</i> seeks to prove that online assessment methods provide a valid measure of performance, equivalent to offline methods.
</p>

<p> 
The author used a quasi-experimental design in which students completed either online or offline assessments for a hybrid psychology course. The assessment was given out to students within the first few weeks of the advanced methods course, and they were allowed 3 weeks to complete and return it by the specified date. Students were randomly assigned to physical or electronic submission groups, and the control groups were allowed to turn in assessments based on their personal preference. 
</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The study found that the mode of submitting assessments had no effect on the assessment results. Requiring students to use their less preferred mode did not impact their scores. 
</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> These results are encouraging for institutions that wish to move to online-only submissions. Traditional classrooms are increasingly using online learning management systems or tools like <a href="http://www.chalkschools.com/">Chalk</a> and <a href="http://turnitin.com/"> Turnitin</a> as document delivery layers. Though these adaptations are sometimes met with resistance, this publication confirms that online submission is equivalent to in-person submission for modern college students. Further research might be necessary to investigate the impact of this change on the quality of the student experience and its suitability for other demographics.
