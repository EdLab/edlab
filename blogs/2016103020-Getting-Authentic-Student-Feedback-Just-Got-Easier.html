<p>Feedback has been cited as one of the most powerful indicators of performance improvement for students. But with over 25 students per class, giving every child the opportunity to have a voice has proven to be a goal too lofty for most educators. The results have been classrooms where smart, extroverted, and struggling vocal students are heard, and the rest of the students pass through the lessons with no opportunities for formative assessments of their progress. However, the platform <a href="https://letsrecap.com">Recap</a>, is trying to change this paradigm.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Recap is easy to use and allows teachers to pose questions to students and track the general consensus of understanding from the class. Students access the question and have thirty seconds to video record their responses. Then they supplement the video response with a short survey of thumbs up (indicating full understanding), thumbs down (indicating little understanding), or something in the middle (indicating some confusion). The results of the short survey are automatically given to the teacher through the dashboard, making its usage simple, intuitive, and immediately gratifying for teachers. These results can also be shared with parents.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Recap does not offer many options for customization of responses. The video option does give students time to speak, but having other write-in or multiple choice questions might allow students who are not strong verbal communicators to have opportunities to shine. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
 
<p>As a former teacher, I would definitely add Recap to my classroom. Although it is still in its beta phase, it offers real opportunities for feedback from every student and can help guide lessons so everyone knows when to move forward and when to revisit a topic. </p>
