            Our increasingly diverse global community illustrates how different cultures are interacting on a daily basis at a rapid rate in such a way that the importance of knowing another language is becoming crucial. Employers are increasingly seeking employees with fluency in a different language in other for them to reach greater markets. Learning another language can be achieved either naturally or artificially. An individual might learn a different language if they were raised around that language or through means of instruction or self-learning. The educational method though is by far the hardest path to learn a new language and often times it can be ineffective in achieving fluency in a specific language. This thus elicits the question as to what is the most effective way of learning a new language.

High schools throughout the nation offer students a variety of the most used languages in the world as an option for their language course requirements. These can range from the romantic languages, Spanish, French, and Italian to eastern languages such Bengali or Mandarin. All these languages though are being taught in such that upon completion of the course, many students don't retain the information learned and thus still lack fluency in that specific language. This can be attributed to the insufficient methods that are being used to teach the language. Some teachers resort to constant repetition and analysis while others simply refuse to speak English and only teach in the language being taught. The students on the other hand are simply memorizing these languages and not receiving the proper context of the language. Such contrary approaches can be the reason why only 1 in 5 high school graduates are <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/1825/about-one-four-americans-can-hold-conversation-second-language.aspx">bilingual</a> with the majority of that statistic compromising students who learned their respective second language at home and not at school. 

In order to learn a language, there are several contributing factors that determine the ability of an individual to achieve fluency. The three major factors essential to learning a new language are environment, usage, and age. Environment and usage go hand in hand due to several underling reasons. If an individual is surrounded by a particular language in a region for a significant amount of time then it is natural for that person to become fairly accustomed with the language well enough. Usage of that language would be mandatory whether in school, social environment or at work, and thus helping improve the fluency of an individual. For example, my former Italian teacher, who previously lacked fluency in that language, was able to fully attain fluency after she resided in Italy for a number of years while working there. 

The most influential factor in determining how well a second language is learned is age. It's a fact that children learn languages better and faster than adults. As an individual grows older, their ability to learn a new language effectively decreases. For instance, research shows it is extremely difficult to improve an accent after the age of twelve. As a child, I grew up in predominantly Twi-speaking Kumasi, Ghana, where the language was spoken almost everywhere, except in school, where English was the language of choice for both instructor and student. Most textbooks and other readings were also in English. In most schools, some form of disciplinary measures were taken if students spoke Twi or any other native language other than English as they were discouraged on school grounds. As much as I initially opposed it, the fact that I was taught English from an early age enabled me to fully achieve fluency two years into my residency here in the United States, much to the surprise of my teachers.

Since age is also the most practical of the three stated factors, it is reasonable for schools to start teaching children a different language at a younger age. It is the most practical way of helping improve the number of older students who achieve fluency in another language since most students simply are not surrounded by the language they're learning.  Schools should devise a system where a child is able to learn a secondary language from elementary school throughout high school (parallel to that of most <a href="http://www.cal.org/resources/digest/0106pufahl.html">European</a> nations), that will enable them to graduate with exceptional fluency in that language.
