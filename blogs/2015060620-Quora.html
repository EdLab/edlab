<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/">Quora</a>, the well-known question and answer site, has become an epicenter of discussion by and around key technology players, places, and companies. With this emphasis on technology, it has also become a warehouse of information an evolving conversation about the present state of edtech. Unlike most informational sites, Quora begins with questions and its content is shaped around the queries of its users. This relevance and community has made Quora the place to go to learn about the trendiest and newest companies, people, and topics in edtech innovation.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The site is replete with information useful for the newbie and veteran alike. Questions like, "which angels have invested in the education technology space?" and "what one piece of education technology (app, site, hardware, or otherwise) would aide teachers' jobs the most?" appeal to a range of audiences that are interested in or involved in edtech. Quora allows users to upvote, downvote, comment on, or share answers and the answers are easily discoverable using Quoraâ€™s excellent search function. Quora also has gained popularity and traction with those in technology, including educational technology startups. This means there is a culture of giving quality answers (and penalizing lesser answers with a downvote). To boot, if you venture to ask a question about a tech startup, even a major company like Facebook, you often get a response from someone who works there.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The major drawbacks are the loss of chronology that results from up and downvoting and the often subjective nature of the answers. Nevertheless, the opinions are often those of highly informed individuals in the space. Answer quality can vary, so Quora might be a better tool for adults and students old enough to have a fully developed critical eye.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaways:</b></p>
<p>Quora is a particularly helpful site for teachers seeking out educational technology products and those with an edtech or entrepreneurial bent. The active and informed technology community on Quora can and often does deliver free personal consulting to entrepreneurs seeking opinions and teachers looking for edtech products to suit their needs. The site is also a great place to hear about new trends and current questions for anyone interested or involved in the edtech space.</p>
