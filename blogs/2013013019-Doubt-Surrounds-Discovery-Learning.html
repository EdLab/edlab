<p><b>Title:</b> Does Discovery-Based Instruction Enhance Learning? (2011)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Louis Alfieri, Patricia J. Brooks, Naomi J. Aldrich, & Harriet R. Tenenbaum <p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Discovery learning is a teaching style that relies on learner-led exploration. Teachers using this style do not provide students with target information or conceptual understanding though they sometimes provide materials and guidance. There are doubts around the effectiveness of discovery learning, especially with younger students who may have trouble formulating their own learning strategy. There are also concerns in all learner age groups about the working memory demands of discovery learning. The increased cognitive load of this type of study may jeopardize the efficacy of the instruction. <a href="http://www.societyforqualityeducation.org/parents/constructivism.pdf">Does Discovery-Based Instruction Enhance Learning?</a> aims to examine these concerns through meta analysis.</p>

<p>The authors did two meta-analyses based on an extensive examination of the discovery learning literature. The first analysis considered instances of pure discovery-based learning. Learning behaviors in this group included teaching oneself, completing practice problems, and conducting simulations. The second analysis examined enhanced or assisted discovery learning. Learners in this group participated in guided discovery and elicited self-explanation.  The authorsâ€™ aim was to examine the effectiveness of discovery learning and evaluate strategies for discovery learning in a diversity of contexts.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
Totally unassisted discovery methods were generally found to be ineffective. Assisted discovery, in the form of scaffolding and worked examples, was more effective. Across all age groups, letting students wander unassisted through content was not effective. A better course of action was discovery learning combined with assistance such as feedback, worked examples, scaffolding, and elicited explanations. The analyses across age groups revealed that adult participants benefit more from enhanced discovery than children. Adolescents benefited least from both assisted and unassisted discovery learning. These findings support the constructivist theory that creating explanations or searching and discovering information is better for learners than being provided with an explanation or being explicitly taught how to succeed on a task.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
These findings may become increasingly important as teachers begin to take a less prominent role in classroom use of digital learning tools. In the design and use of these tools, educators should seek tools that provide instruction and feedback. Educators should also strive to give students a context for discovery and learning online, particularly with younger students. Future research on this topic might examine the best practices for scaffolding, worked examples, in-class feedback, and realtime direct instructions. Incorporation of these elements might ensure that the digital educational tools we produce facilitate effective learning.</p>
