          <p>
            EdLabers,

It's that time, the time to introduce a public ready version of the PK Viewer (that's right, we don't do beta). 

Check out the <a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/gallery_home">PK Viewer.</a>

We envisioned the PK Viewer to be a place where researchers, students and gawkers alike could go and view the Gottesman Libraries art collections. We've worked hard over the past month to not only develop the Viewer to our exacting standards but to also incorporate some of the ideas that came out of the fruitful EdLab Seminar.

Here are some of the features of the Viewer that I'm sure you'll appreciate

1. 4 views: the Viewer lets you preview images as a list of thumbnails, as a text based list or as single images in both a "slideshow" and "non-slideshow" format.

2. Organization: The Viewer maintains pocket categorization (you can't view all thumbnails in all pockets at once) but lets you organize within a pocket by date, title and artist/photographer.

3. Slideshow: we've not only built an auto-play slideshow but also given you controls so you can see what you want, at the speed and the order in which you want it. To enhance the viewing experience we've included a "hide navigation" button that will hide everything that is not the image and the description of the piece. All of these are on a black background that makes all the images really pop!

4. Search: the search feature lets you search across all pockets and gives you answers that are relevant with a custom ranking system. The search results give you a preview of the image so you're not just receiving text results.

5. Downloading: you can now download individual files in low or medium resolution. If you would like to download hires versions you can contact the Library to receive permission.

*BONUS*
As a bonus feature we've built into the Viewer the idea of "user action persistence". That's just a fancy phrase that means the Viewer remembers what you did last and remembers your preference if you go back to a page or if you go to another section. For example, lets say you started on the Federico Castellon Memorial Print Section in the thumbnail view, organized by title, and on the second page. You then click on an image on the second page to see it at a larger size. On the single image view, you decide that it's not the image you wanted to see and click on the thumbnails link to go back to thumbnails page. The Viewer remembers your organization and pagination preferences (title, page 2) and places you exactly where you left from. This is true throughout the site, so if you organize images by artist in the text view or thumbnail view page and then switch to the slideshow page, the slideshow will be organized by artist.

Check out the site and let us know what you think. We'd love any feedback you'd like to give us. This includes everything from, "Sathe, you moron you forgot to include my feature request, explain yourself!!!" to "Ankit, that's some solid programming, especially love the search results!" and everything in between.

Feedback: pravin@pravinsathe.com or come by my or Ankit's desk.

P.S.
There were some limitations to this project which I've outlined below:

1. Design: We needed to stick with the overall design and feel of PK in order to make a strong connection to the primary app so we couldn't really do anything ground breaking or earth shattering from a graphic design perspective.

2. Only Library Art Collections: we had to stick with the Library's art collections because we didn't want to wade into the deep end of the pool with regard to permissions. Currently, PK lets you assign specific permissions to your pockets and files within those pockets. Moreover, there are layers of permissions, university only, private and general public. Because of the university layer we would have had to deal with the WIND authentication system which we thought was outside the scope of this work. This does of course limit what we can show to pockets that the Library creates or to those who have contacted us to be included in the viewer (which you can do, by clicking on Contact on the website)

3. Only images: at the moment, we're only showing images but the system can handle video. We're exploring that possibility but at the moment there aren't enough videos out there to justify it (unless we start adding the AfterEd videos)

4. Server Space: we're running close to capacity on the server so moving forward it looks like we'll need more space if we want to (and we do want to) upload the 10k images that are still in analog or digital form but not in PK
