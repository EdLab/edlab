            The Third Primary Education Development Program (PEDP III) is an organization in Bangladesh that supports the government in improving the quality of education as well as increasing the net enrollment and completion rates in primary education. According to the<a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/12/10/educating-tomorrows-leaders-in-bangladesh">World Bank</a>, Bangladesh as one of the nations that struggles to provide a better education for its citizens at the primary level. Although the country has made some effort in enrolling 98.6% children and helping 73.8% of those children to graduate, there still remain some challenges that needs to be tackled. For instance, overcrowded schools, hiring unqualified teachers, lack of motivation, and student dropouts are some of the remaining issues that need to be addressed.

A lot of children drop out of school in Bangladesh because they cannot afford the tuition, buy educational materials, or has to travel a very long distance to attend classes. These bad conditions are unbearable for the children to the extent that they basically attend school and receive no better teaching. In essence, this alone might explain why some students are dropping out of school. However, that is not the goal; the goal is to make them remain in school and ultimately graduate to become active and productive citizens. This is why PEDP III has been established to reduce social disparities in primary education, improve the quality of the learning environment, and improve effectiveness of resource use for primary education in Bangladesh.
