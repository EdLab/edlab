<p>There is no denying the international push for STEM education. Yet, in the U.S., at most <a href="https://www.heri.ucla.edu/nih/downloads/AIR2012HurtadoPrimingthePump.pdf">half of students</a> entering college with the intention of graduating with a STEM bachelorâ€™s degree end up earning that degree within six years. In order to increase student retention rates in these majors, a recent study investigated methods of classroom instruction in middle school, high school, and university-level STEM classes in order to determine how methods differ at different levels of schooling and how they shape student interest in STEM.</p>
 
<p>Researchers conducted 364 class observations at the University of Maine as well as observations of 82 teachers from 137 schools around the university. The data collected categorized instructional approaches taken in each classroom based on the Classroom Observational Protocol for Undergraduate STEM (COPUS), which identifies frequency and types of student activity (e.g., listening, individual thinking, worksheet group work) and instructor activity (e.g., lecturing, posing questions, one-on-one student discussions). As one of the first studies to compare educational practices across different levels of schooling, this study adapted the COPUS for middle and high school STEM settings, with special attention being paid to whether or not the instructor employed a student-centered learning model. Questionnaires were also distributed and collected to track student opinion and teacher perceptions.</p>
 
<p>The study revealed that while middle school and high school students spent a significant amount of time in STEM classes engaging in active-learning activities, university courses centered largely around instructor-centered strategies, such as lecturing. Students were more engaged in class and were more likely to participate in self-regulated learning habits outside of class, such as setting up study groups, when they were exposed to student-centered learning. Despite differences in class size, length of class period, and laboratory work opportunities, the shift in instructional strategies had the largest effect on student interest in university classes.</p>

<p>Instructors struggled to identify the length of time they spent lecturing and expressed uncertainty about what STEM instruction looks like at different levels of schooling, demonstrating a clear disconnect which the authors of the study emphasize needs fixing. If we are to retain student interest in STEM programs, not only does active-learning need to be central, but the disconnect between teacher planning and actual instruction at different levels of education needs to be exposed and addressed.</p>
