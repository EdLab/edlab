ROBERT SCHLOSS 
Robert J (Bob) Schloss, Senior Technical Staff Member, Cognitive Knowledge & Information Systems department 

Bob joined IBM T J Watson Research Center in 1982, after product development experience with IBM in the Hudson Valley which followed his degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from Yale.  Bob's life was changed through an amazing NSF-funded summer experience he had during high school.   

Bob is an expert in metadata and semantic data models, having made major contributions to, or lead the standardization and open-source implementation and IBM proprietary implementation of content labelling standards (W3C Platform for Internet Content Selection, Dublin Core, Resource Description Framework (RDF), Extensible Markup Language (XML), and prefers to approach new domains (in the last 5 years, the domains he worked intensively with include Smart Power Grid, Smarter Cities Operations Centers, and now Education) by learning about what behaviors by people and by applications product and consumer what kinds of information, how that information is distributed, how the credibility of that information improves or decays over time, and then adjusting web technologies (whether URIs, CSV, RDF, XML, JSON, XMI, OSLC, OWL, REST APIs, Query Languages, Rules Languages or whatever) to be as simple as possible for those people, organizations and applications, while meeting requirements and allowing for "as the system continues to run... new attributes and new entity types and new cross-entity relationships can be introduced".  He is currently evaluating the potential of Linked Data to be used by IMS Global standards and by IBM's IDEAL software for Education.   

Bob is a senior member of the ACM and of the IEEE.  Bob's technology is used in the infrastructure for IBM offering's as diverse as Watson, Websphere, DB2, InfoSphere Information Server, Intelligent Operations Center... and he is currently working on enhancements to the IBM Filenet and IBM Content Analytics offerings.   

Bob was a major contributor to the 2013 and 2014 IBM "Global Technology Outlook" positions on Contextual Computing, Cognitive Computing, and Data Services in the Cloud and believes these ideas apply strongly to the Education and Learning domain  He is a member of IBM's Academy of Technology, the cross-company body of IBM's most active technical innovators.  He was a member of the National Research Council's 30-month study group which produced the book "Youth, Pornography and the Internet" (National Academy of Sciences Press), and continues to be interested in how people's use of information, applications and communications in "cyberspace" changes them.
