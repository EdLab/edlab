<p><i>"Building Beats is a registered non-profit organization that develops and expands DJ and music education programs that teach entrepreneurial, leadership, and life skills."</i> (from the <a=href "http://www.buildingbeats.org/"> Building Beats</a> website)</p>

<p><b>Education Through Music</b><br>
<a=href "http://www.buildingbeats.org/">Building Beats</a> is based in New York City and provides workshops, space, and technology to help develop and teach leadership, entrepreneurial, and life skills through DJ-ing and music production to underserved youth. The organization envisions a world where anyone, from anywhere, can pursue their musical passion and build a career out of it. Participants are guided to become "self-sufficient creative producers," which can help put students on the path toward leading fulfilling lives. Communities are built by connecting students with working music producers, artists, creatives, DJs, and entrepreneurs; all of whom want to give back to future generations. </p>

<p><b>Building Beats Workships</b><br>
With the use of tables, iPads, mobile apps, laptops, and music production software, Building Beats teaches music theory, DJ fundamentals, and music production.  Building Beats can hold workshops at schools, after school programs, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG0HEuG96W8">summer school curriculums</a>. The Point, Scratch DJ Academy, Electric Run, and Beat NYC are a few organizations currently collaborating with and donating space for Building Beats extracurricular workshops. This Spring, Building Beats will be holding music education workshops at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQte-0QnxNw">Carnegie Hallâ€™s Weill Music Institute</a> for underserved youth and teens from parole centers.</p>

<p>Building Beats empowers students with entrepreneurial and leadership skills through music, DJ, and production education. The technical education students receive in the program could help them visualize and pursue careers in the music industry or pivot towards other creative technology hobbies and learning. Building Beats is a strong and innovative foundation for both technology and art creation.</p>
