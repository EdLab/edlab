            The recent riots in Baltimore over the death of Freddie Gray have brought the issue of race and class firmly back in the national spotlight. Some social scientists believe the riots, especially in Baltimore, were inevitable. The living conditions for some of Baltimore's residents are on par with those in developing countries. For instance, Baltimore had a murder rate that was higher than that of Honduras, the most homicidal nation on earth. Many of the adults in Baltimore also did not have jobs and residents in its inner cities live in what amounts to slums. Gray's death essentially served as a catalyst that brought into life the abysmal conditions for some of Baltimore's residents.

The solution to <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21650545-problems-places-west-baltimore-require-focus-safety-and-schools-not-race-fixing?fsrc=scn/tw/te/pe/st/fixingamericasinnercities" target = "blank">resolving some of the issues</a> lies in the education system. Schools have historically been the place where governments and society in general have turned to in times of crisis (e.g. space exploration during the Cold War, AIDS epidemic in the 80s and 90s, etc.,). In many inner cities like Baltimore, kids are not completing school and have few community programs to keep them engaged during after school (when most are susceptible to land in trouble). This translates to few opportunities to break the cycle of poverty. Additionally, it presents opportunities for educators to bring such issues in the classroom since it is current and applies to the lives of many students in the inner city.
