            Summarizing what I've read from the book “UX Design for Startups” by Marcin Treder
There were times when engineering was everything. This was about the time Facebook was found. Engineering stars were rocking the world, and PHP and Rails were pretty much synonymous to startups.

Well, there has always been one startup that focuses on UX since the dawn of personal computers. It's named Apple. Steve Jobs, the founder, was a Liberal Arts college dropout. Among his competitors and peers were computer scientists and engineers like Woz (Apple), Gates (Microsoft) and Joy (Sun Microsystems). When the concept of user interface was just showing at the horizon, he envisioned how computers should bring joy and delight to people's lives. That early vision of user experience has been the driving force of his company and has made it the world's most valuable company today.

Users do not care about the technology behind a product. Do we care how great artists use linseed and turpentine in his palette? Or do we only care if an art moves us spiritually and leave us with a transformative feeling? I have been on Quora for some time and I've noticed that many developers are curious about how Pinterest and Instagram were built with Python or how Medium was built on Node.js and Go. Users, our patrons, only care about how a product change (and doesn't get in the way of) their lives.

Today, things are finally heading Jobs' way unanimously. What's facing the users is all that matters. The age of technology has ended. The ecosystem has changed in a way that it's super easy for anyone with commitment to launch an app or a game. Dave McClure, the founder of 500 Startups–one of the most prominent incubators in the world, said, “design and marketing aren't just as important as engineering; they are way more important.”

Therefore, UX and design in general shouldn't be left solely for designers. No more designers who only work on photoshopped UI elements, developers who only know how to code with minimal lines and idiomatically or copywriters who only know how to write concise, grabbing tag lines. Design thinking is what everyone in a product team should be thinking about. A design of a product should involve every stakeholder. Each one of them should have a say and knowledge of the process. A successful product means an ongoing, fast-looped collaborative endeavor.
We should all stop thinking about features but instead about the differences we are making for the users. This way, we won't be bogged down into the details of tools and craft and more about what it takes to improve our customers' lives. Features go as far as satisfying users' experience, and they should be killed without hesitation should they fail to do so.
