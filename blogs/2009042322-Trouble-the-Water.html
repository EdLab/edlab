          <p>
            I just finished watching the Hurricane Katrina documentary, <a href="http://www.troublethewaterfilm.com/"><i>Trouble the Water</a></i>, on HBO. I heard about the documentary a few weeks ago while reading JET magazine and so I decided to check it out for myself. The film, which was nominated for best documentary at this year's Academy Awards, recounts the horrifying moments during the storm through homemade videos and first person narration from Kimberly Rivers Roberts with help from her husband Scott, both residents of the Lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans. 

The documentary starts with Kimberly filming her neighbors on the eve of the storm. Her neighborhood was all but desolate at that point as the vast majority of residents had already evacuated. Those who remained, especially a young girl who bravely testified that she was not afraid of the impending storm, either had no means of evacuating or didn't want to leave New Orleans. The most powerful moment of the film is when the levees gave way to the force of the hurricane. At this point, the Lower Ninth Ward was essentially a vast ocean and Kimberly and some of her neighbors took refuge in her house, where she comforted them with offers of food and drinks. She recorded the efforts of a neighbor who was swimming from house to house trying to save as many people as he can. 

The remainder of the documentary details the efforts of Kimberly, Scott and a few of their friends in the days after Katrina: they find the decomposed body of one of her neighbors who was prominently featured at the beginning of the film in the days before the storm. There are also many news clips intertwined with Kimberly's footage to give the audience a greater understanding of the controversies and issues surrounding Katrina. 

Overall, I highly recommend the film because not only does it offer a first hand account and footage of Katrina through the eyes and voices of those who experienced the worse of her wrath, it is an emotional and sometimes funny look at the lives of how a few residents in the <i>Big Easy</i> dealt with one of America's great natural disasters. On a personal note, I saw most of the Lower Ninth Ward when I went to New Orleans last summer and one of the streets I <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/1949">vividly described in a blog</a> was featured in the film.
