<p>How can educators align video games with their existing learning goals and instructional knowledge? Critiques of children’s video gaming have characterized it as a distracting and potentially violent pastime, but recent literature shows no evidence of negative impacts. The authors of this piece explored the major factors that could help explain the impact of using video games to support classroom learning. </p>

<p>The authors frame their interpretation of video games around children’s play, which addresses children’s intrinsic motivation similar to their engagement in regular play, full of moments of exploration and decision-making. They further conceptualize video games as designed experiences and suggest several essential design principles that educators may take into account when considering a video game for educational use. For example, by evaluating the learning and assessment mechanics underlying gameplay, teachers may relate specific games to the learning contexts in their own classrooms. </p>

<p>Video games can help children develop situated understandings of phenomena through their simulated activities via motion-sensing technologies such as Nintendo’s Wii or Mircosoft’s Kinect. Parallel to conventional reading, writing and video watching in the classroom, digital gaming complements classroom activities and can be viewed as part of the variety of learning platforms made available for student learning. </p>

<p>Teachers may also utilize the instant feedback feature in a game to support students’ constructive learning. Unlike traditional classroom learning that minimizes negative feedback, in video games players learn about the norm of adjusting their play strategies based on instant systematic feedback and they are allowed to try over and over again. They can also make choices toward increasingly complex game operations. In this way, educational games can be customized by individual players, making their learning experiences personalized and differentiated.</p>

<p>The authors conclude with a reflective framework of guiding questions for teachers to use as they consider video games for learning, including the selection of appropriate games for students’ social constructivist development in the same way they adopt social, child-centered teaching approaches in their typical lessons. The framework highlights the designed learning journeys favored by the authors, with inquiries and discoveries rather than the delivery of passive, direct knowledge. </p>
