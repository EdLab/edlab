<p>Darwin had his famous field notes on his evolutionary tree and his studies on the Galapagos finches. Marie Curie had papers upon papers of her studies on polonium and radium. Scientists then and now are always expected to keep careful notes on their observations and experiments, and most science teachers make an effort to have their students adopt the same practice. But with new forms of technology available for teachers and students in schools, the focus has shifted to how the traditional art of scientific notetaking can be updated for modern times. The authors of this study used a digital science notebook, CyberPad, to provide content and scaffold learning for 309 fourth grade students engaged in a magnetism unit in their respective classrooms.</p>
 
<p>While using the CyberPad, students were prompted to write textual responses to certain prompts and draw pictures that represented certain phenomena or their understandings of a scientific concept. For example, one prompt asked students to draw their observations for when a magnet interacts with elements like a straw, a paper clip, and both magnetic and non-magnetic particles. The objects are in a menu at the bottom of the screen, and students can select them and place them on the drawing space where they see fit. The researchers designed a rubric to evaluate the written and graphic responses from the students.</p>
 
<p>The researchers found that in most categories, students scored twice as high with their drawings compared to their writings in the same topic, which they emphasized is significant because the drawings had fewer possible points available on the rubric. The authors also used a tool to analyze correlations between the drawing and writing rubric scores, which showed that the drawings better allowed students to express their understanding compared to the writing responses.</p>
 
<p>Although digital science notebooks are by no means universal in classrooms (especially not elementary classrooms, where science is often an elective rather than a core subject), this study provides insight on how elementary students in particular can best show their understanding of scientific concepts, and how teachers can best use tools like digital notebooks to probe for that understanding in order to inform their next steps in instruction. Not only will keeping a digital science notebook help teachers plan, but it will also help students become familiar with the same practice that hundreds of scientists, from Darwin to Curie, used to make scientific breakthroughs.</p>
