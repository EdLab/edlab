Online Statbook is a project developed by David Lane at Price University to teach statistics.  At its core it's an introductory level statistics book, although resources include textbook style lessons, quizzes with instant feedback, and interactive demonstrations of statistical concepts and tools.  It's freely available at the linked website.
<!--break-->
<b>Pros:</b>
It's the exercises that first drew me to Online Statbook.  From an outsider's perspective, it seems to be fairly difficult to understand statistics without some experience manipulating data and applying statistical concepts, even if the logic is clear.   To demonstrate and provide familiarity with the concepts it discusses, at the appropriate moments in the lesson Online Statbook creates a little java applet that will allow you to practice statistics without the busywork of setting up graphs, or punching in a lot of data into a calculator.  Although the website feels somewhat primitive it actually gets everything done with a minimum of fuss.

<b>Cons:</b>
Still, everything is a bit clunky, and the pace of learning sometimes feels too fast, and sometimes too slow (this may be a problem limited to ignorant humanities majors like myself).  There are also gaps in the current (2.0) version of the textbook, which are hopefully in the process of being filled in. This applies as well to the multimedia aspect of the lesson, which is fairly lacking. 

<b>Edlab Relevance:</b>
I often get the feeling that, for many people, moving courses online means photocopying the textbook and uploading some videotaped lectures.  But why shouldn't the computer be used to provide structured hands-on practice at the same time?  Online Statbook is a paradigm for the kind of thing I'd like to see in educational software going forward.  Of course, your mileage may vary.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
Online Statbook is the best resource I've found yet for learning statistics on your own.  If, for whatever reason, you missed out on that course offering in college, I highly recommend it.
