<i>Entering into our second year of operation, P-TECH continues to chart new territory in the reform of secondary and postsecondary education in the United States. As the first school in the nation that connects high school, college, and the world of work through deep, meaningful partnerships, we are pioneering a new vision for college and career readiness and success.</i>
(<a href="http://www.ptechnyc.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1">P-TECH</a>).
<p>

<b>A Professional Path to STEM Employment</b><br>
Pathways in Technology Early College High School (P-TECH) is a vocational school in Brooklyn that blends traditional secondary experience with post-secondary vocational training. As student loan debt and unemployment continue to rise, this unique program, now in its second year of operation, seems like a valuable new hybrid approach to training learners in the applied sciences and STEM subjects.  Viewed as an "alternative pathway" to an associates degree, the program (the first of its kind in the nation) utilizes a proprietary "9-14" (spans grades 9-14) approach to graduating students in six years with a combined degree.  Building on existing momentum behind both career and technical education and a <a href="http://www.advance.rackham.umich.edu/ncid/assessing_programs.pdf">desire to discover new ways to provide relevant STEM training for minority students</a>, the program offers an affordable continuing education model neatly folded into the traditional high school experience.  
<p>
<b>Can "Big Blue" Help Beat Unemployment?</b><br>
The P-TECH curriculum was developed in partnership with IBM.  This practice of developing courses in conjunction with a corporate sponsor is in-line with previous <a href="http://www.highered.nysed.gov/kiap/SmartScholarsEarlyCollegeHighSchool_000.htm">"Smart Scholars" programs developed by the State of New York</a>.  Long considered a viable employment opportunity for young people in upstate NY, the initiative helps take elements of "Big Blue" to Brooklyn.  Will the tech behemoth help P-TECH to build a viable career pipeline for <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/story/2012-07-13/youth-unemployment-taxes-teenagers/56178650/1">young people who increasingly feel that the job market is a hopeless obstacle to overcome</a>?  Only the first cohort of graduates slated to finish the program by 2017 will tell.    
<p>
<b>Fast-tracking the Future, While Slow-boating Maturity?</b><br>
While potentially providing a new model for career and technical education that would replace a need for separate college degrees and vocational training, there may be a danger inherent in short-circuiting the growth and maturity that comes from separating high school and further education.  There is even <a href="http://thechoice.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/24/the-gap-year-breaking-up-the-cradle-to-college-to-cubicle-to-cemetery-cycle/">evidence<a/> that this break of the "Cradle to College" cycle might benefit a learnerâ€™s grade point average.  Many (most often British upper-class) Europeans take this seriously and follow a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/a-primer-on-gap-years/2012/09/20/005d2a5c-033f-11e2-91e7-2962c74e7738_blog.html">"gap year"</a> tradition of proudly adhering to a break in education.  Regardless, can <a href="http://business.time.com/2012/09/27/the-student-debt-epidemic-1-in-5-households-now-owe-student-loans/">debt</a> and time-strapped American youth really afford to delay their degree?  And most importantly, can or should we compare liberal arts and professional education?  Instead, as more liberal arts institutions <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-12-31/liberal-arts-colleges-forced-to-evolve-with-market">seek to provide increasingly relevant "work-focused" pre-professional learning</a> will the term "liberal arts" will be eclipsed by "Tech Arts"?
