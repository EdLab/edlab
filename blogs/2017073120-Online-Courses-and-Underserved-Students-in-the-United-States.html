<p>Massive open online courses have proliferated across all sectors of education in recent years. Due to their accessibility and low costs, they  have been lauded as revolutionary tools that are truly expanding education for all. However, new research is now pushing back on those lofty accolades of educational democratization. In a sample of over 2600 online learners in 400 different courses across various platforms, researchers from Northern Illinois University found that some racial and ethnic minorities and less affluent populations are dramatically underrepresented in these kinds of online courses. Further, general motivations for learning online also varied.</p>

<p>Comparing the national representative sample to the US Census population numbers, the researchers found that both African Americans and Hispanic/Latinos were significantly underrepresented in online courses, accounting for only 4% and 7% of the total sample, respectively. For those who were enrolled, in general white participants were more likely to complete courses when compared to their African American counterparts. Older, non-employed, white males were the most likely of any population to complete online courses.</p> 

<p>In a clear educational divide, individuals with only a high school education, those who had completed some college but had no degree, or those who had an associates degrees were all underrepresented in the enrollment numbers, while those with a bachelor's degree or above were all overrepresented. Further, those in the sample also tended to come from more affluent professions and had relatively higher incomes than the general American population. However, those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds actually reported more positive gains from their online course experiences.</p>
 
<p>The researchers also explored motivations for enrolling online. They found that in general, the entire population was more interested in increasing knowledge or skills rather than educational advancement. But, when breaking down motivations by race, they found that African Americans were more likely to take online courses for educational advancement when compared to their white peers. Similarly, non-native English speakers were also more likely to choose these online courses for educational advancement when compared to the native English-speaking population. </p>
 
<p>This research provides a better understanding of the participant populations and motivations for enrollment. If large groups are excluded from MOOCs, then existing inequalities along racial, educational, and income lines will continue. The authors hope that their research will be used to help expand the potential democratic educational effects of online learning to these underserved populations.</p>
