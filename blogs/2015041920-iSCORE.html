<p>Developed by music educators at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, <a href="http://www.rcmusic.ca/iscore-home-page">iSCORE</a> is a digital communication and planning platform designed to aid music students in their study and practice. It is freely available to teachers and students for use in the classroom or outside for independent work. Music students create their own digital profiles and goals, and use iSCORE's built in communication, annotation, and composition tools to share and realize their objectives. Teachers can also chat with students, schedule lessons, and distribute course documents through the platform. The design goal of iSCORE is to facilitate students' self-regulation and individualized study including practicing, music learning, and music creation.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Independent study and practice for music students can be hard to manage and regulate on a schedule. iSCORE includes multiple work cycles that allow users to set goals; accomplish work by making documents, media links, and audio recordings; and reflect upon the projects to understand what went well and what needs improvement. The interconnectivity of iSCORE's platform allows colleagues and professors to support one another and provide feedback outside of the classroom environment. During content creation, iSCORE also provides unique access to other programs to support music education including Audacity (an audio editor and recorder software), Mixxx (mp3 mixing software), and Noteflight (music notation software).</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The ideal environment for iSCORE is as a supplement to music courses. Teachers and students can augment the lessons and exercises from class with outside communication and feedback. For students not affiliated with a music school, however, iSCORE is unable to create that strong support community that encourages music practice. The interface of iSCORE is also rather sparse and not visually engaging. Its functionality and content are the most important aspects of the platform, but further design elements would enhance the music learning experience.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>For students, iSCORE strengthens musical skills, increases enjoyment in practicing, and allows for self-regulated learning while also introducing students to digital tools in their education. Teachers are able to take music instruction beyond the classroom with iSCORE and share in the progress each student makes. As iSCORE continues to develop and spread internationally to music schools, it also has the potential to influence arts education curriculum and facilitate distance learning music courses.</p>
