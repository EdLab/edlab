          <p>
            Every now and again when I walk into the office with a new handful of tomatoes from EdLab's garden project (which entered a new phase on Friday as we moved the remaining plants up to the tower to see if we could keep them productive through the winter), someone walks up to me and earnestly says "Ooh! Sustainable!"

There is a great deal of misunderstanding out there about what is "sustainable." Six planters of tomato plants which produce maybe a handful of edible tomatoes a week... let's say it takes some imagination to call that "sustainable." (Especially when the office's collective enthusiasm for watering the plants gave out in September. Sorry -- not to be bitter. And AfterEd's team gave excellent on-demand help on Friday in moving the garden to its winter home, so I'm not complaining.) How many of us do those tomatoes even feed? Would they "sustain" us if we weren't also supporting our diet with factory-farmed animals, mono-cropped grains, and vitamin supplements that come from lord knows where? I'd say those tomatoes are better labeled "delicious." Let's just leave it at that.

An article in Mother Jones earlier this year really made me rethink what I thought I knew about "sustainable" organic farming practices. The article made it clear that <a href="http://motherjones.com/environment/2009/02/spoiled-organic-and-local-so-2008">organic farming practices are not scalable to support the sheer number of people on the planet at this point in time.</a> It made the case that the continued use of <i>some</i> conventional farming practices, like the use of pesticides, may be necessary in order to even spread the influence of earth-friendly methods further.

As our friends in the cognitive science program argue, we could all benefit from developing our systems thinking further. Most of us have a very vague sense of all the factors that go into growing our food, providing us power and water, and removing the tons of garbage which we produce every day. Sobering looks at the latter appear in Harper's Magazine with some regularity. The magazine's articles on <a href="http://www.harpers.org/archive/2006/12/0081312">residents of a Philippines garbage dump,</a> the <a href="http://www.harpers.org/archive/2007/01/0081345">continent-sized spill of plastic trash in the Pacific,</a> and <a href="http://www.harpers.org/archive/2009/12/0082753">the reasons why the Superfund cleanup of the Hudson is not effective</a> may make you want to never purchase or throw anything away ever again.

The latest article on sustainability to catch my eye is on <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/dec/06/internet-dirty-secret-emissions-data">the carbon footprint of the Internet.</a> To wit: We don't know enough about it yet. Despite excitement that the digital revolution will eliminate paper waste and obviate the need for business commuters to pollute the skies with the jet fuel they expend on the way to meetings, we must also take into account the energy needs of server farms, and the pollution that will cause. Not to mention the energy we all use to keep our computers running, and again, the problems caused by the digital trash we throw away (if you didn't click through on that Harper's article about <a href="http://www.harpers.org/archive/2006/12/0081312">children in the Philippines burning the plastic off wires to make a few cents off the copper within,</a> please, do it now, or for an even more alarming take on the same topic, check out Filipino director Khavn de la Cruz's movie <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&hs=J5g&q=squatterpunk+Khavn+de+la+Cruz&aq=f&oq=&aqi=">Iskwaterpangk (Squatter Punk).</a>)

Sustainable? Sorry, guys -- <a href="http://www.oneplanetliving.org/index.html">not the way we live, as Americans.</a> Perhaps the best we can hope for is treading a little more lightly. Maybe we could start by turning off office computers at night. (And I could still use some help watering those plants ^_^)
