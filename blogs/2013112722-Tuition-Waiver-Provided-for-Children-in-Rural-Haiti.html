            I knew for sure that the education system in Haiti has endured some hardships since the devastating earthquake in January 2010. However, I didn't know that prior to the earthquake, nearly half a million children in Haiti did not attend school. Then again, what is the purpose of attending school if 84% of schoolteachers didn't have the right credentials to teach, as it's the case in Haiti? This is one of many educational issues currently facing Haiti is facing.

To provide the necessary help the Haitian people need in terms of education, the World Bank has form a partnership with IDB, CDB, CIDA, and the Global Partnership for Education in funding a project in Haiti. The big part of the project is <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2013/11/25/improving-access-to-schooling-and-learning-for-poor-children-in-rural-haiti">providing tuition waiver</a> for approximately 200, 000 disadvantaged children from rural areas in Haiti. Since 80% of existing schools in Haiti are private, the best way to make sure that these disadvantage children are able to attend school is to pay for their tuition, which is about $90 per student. Moreover, the tuition waiver covers textbooks and provide qualified teachers. So far, there have been good signs that the program has been beneficial to a lot of children and their families since it was introduced.
