          <p>
            When discussing the state of education beyond high school, the certificate is almost always left out and forgotten, and yet according to a <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/sites/default/server_files/files/06_01_12%20Certificates%20Full%20Report%20FINAL.pdf">recent report</a> from the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, it is the fastest-growing form of college credential. To give you a comparison in 1984 less than 2 percent of adults had a certification as their highest educational attainment, by 2009 the percentage has increased to almost 12 percent, according to the survey of Income and Program Participation. According to the survey 24 percent of all 23-65 year-old workers have responded that they had attended a vocational, technical, trade, or business program at some point beyond high school. This shows that certificates does not have to be the end of the educational career of many students, it can also be seen as a stepping stone to higher forms of education such as undergraduate, or graduate schools.

These results are definitely reflective of the economic times we are living it. One can deduce that people are obtaining these certificates as a faster and more cost efficient way of obtaining the credentials for a decent paying job or career. Also that once they have obtained their job through the certificate, people would then have enough money to start undergraduate college. Which speaks volumes about what lengths some people must go through to pay for college. Certificates could be becoming the more popular degree to get right out of high school.
