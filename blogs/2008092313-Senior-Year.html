          <p>
            When I started my senior year at tiny <a href=“http://www.spc.edu/pages/1.asp”>St. Peter's College</a> nearly a month ago, I had no inclination it was going to be going this quickly. College has been one of the most eye-opening and fulfilling experience I've had in my brief life. I came into senior year with a lot of expectations. First, I wanted to continue the academic progress I've been making in the past three years to ensure my chances of gaining admittance to a top graduate school. As an accounting major, I want to further this interest in the not so distant future. Second, as one of a few seniors on the men's soccer team (as an all purpose <a href="http://www.spc.edu/pages/2316.asp?ssid=5006&bid=3363">defender</a>), I had the responsibility of stepping up as a leader for my younger teammates as we tried to emulate our success last season where we became the first sports team in the school's history to gain an at large bid to the NCAA Division I tournament. Though we succumbed to the University of Virginia on a cold November night, we retained the bulk of the squad and I am sure we can reach those heights again this season. A slow start to the season (losses to Big East powerhouses UConn and Seton Hall) has seen us rebounded with a four game unbeaten streak. <p>

I am planning on obtaining an internship immediately after the season as I want to get an early start on the job market in what is a slow economy. As a soon to be graduate, I want to remain optimistic about the market but recent events have led me to become very pessimistic. I'm hoping things will get better by the time I accept my diploma in May. In the winter, I will resume training with my club team JC Azzurri (where fellow EdLabers George Nantwi and Adam Mitchinson serve as teammates). Following our first ever championship, we are hoping for a repeat performance. The spring term will certainly bring the curtain down on my four incredible years at St. Peter's with commencement. Since I redshirted as a freshman in soccer, I still have a year of eligibility left meaning I can prolong college for another year, a thought I will give considerable time.
