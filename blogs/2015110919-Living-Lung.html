<p>What does a lung <i>actually</i> look like? How do they look when they fill with air? <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/living-lung-lung-viewer/id583442163?mt=12">Living Lung</a> is a real-time 3D medical education and patient communication tool that brings the mysterious world of the human body to life. This app includes respiratory models based on real human imaging data and the most accurate 3D modeling technology available. Given the subject matter, you might have guessed that Living Lung is designed for secondary students and older. </p>
 
<p>Living Lung is incredibly visually detailed. Curious users can zoom in to any location to explore a variety of anatomical features as well as rotate around the lung with ease. The app focuses on lungs, the rib cage, and other structures in this vicinity. Users can also investigate bronchi and vascular components through the aid of animated transparent structures.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Living Lung is a sophisticated tool that is lifelike in its visual rendition of the human lung. As such, it is incredibly useful for traditional medical education settings and those who are learning about the science of breathing. A common visual representation can be shared when dealing with complex concepts like the respiratory system—no guesswork is necessary.</p>
 
<p>Interactivity on Living Lung is first rate. Users can change breathing rates to affect lung volume and display the physical impact of breathing on internal structures. Color-coded labels make studying the names of various segments of the lung as easy as red, white, and blue. And don’t worry, labels maintain the correct anatomical location during any screen navigation to prevent user disorientation and confusion. </p>
 
<p>Besides more formal educational settings, Living Lung could also prove to be a valuable asset in health care use cases. Using the accurate visual data as a consistent focal point could clarify issues among doctors, nurses, and student interns as they communicate in life-or-death, real-time scenarios. Also, this app could be useful when medical students perform rounds to visit patients as part of their training. Instead of vaguely referring to an adverse respiratory problem, the app could be used to clarify possible misunderstandings and pinpoint where the issue might be occurring. Also, in medical situations involving those who speak second languages or are hearing impaired, the visual interface could improve communication and literally save lives. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Living Lung provides an abundance of sophisticated information to users, specifically anatomical labels. Novices may find this overwhelming and miss learning about the overall structure of the respiratory system due to the high level of detail. Also, due to its life-like, high resolution images, legacy tablets may have a problem processing the visuals. Although the literature attests to "real-time 3D," high-end graphical users know to be cautious when the terms "real-time" and "3D" are placed together. Furthermore, the life-like image of the lung may be off-putting to the squeamish, limiting its application to all stakeholders in educational as well as medical settings. Finally, the labels are functional and legible, but the anatomical names are necessarily long and difficult to read due to the inherent complexity of the subject matter.
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Living Lung’s pristine graphical quality and robust interactivity attests to the talent and work ethic of the design team. The richly detailed images show great promise as an accurate tool for science and medical education. For the same reason, Living Lung could easily be adaptable to a wide variety of health care environments, especially if this app was combined with other equally high-quality apps if they are available for other parts of the anatomy. The highly detailed information may prove overwhelming to English language learners, younger students or those with remedial literacy abilities. Given these provisos, if you were ever curious about what a lung looks like or how it functions, Living Lung will breathe life into the awesome complexity of our respiratory systems.</p>
