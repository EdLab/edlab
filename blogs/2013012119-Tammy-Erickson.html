Tammy Erickson is an expert on the jobs crisis for Gen. X and is helping to identify what is lacking in the educational system that leads to a deficiency of workers that align with current required job skills.  Her work might help us identify what we should be teaching the knowledge workers of the future, instead of perpetuating  ill-prepared workers geared toward an obsolete market.  Explore her thoughts on mobile technologies and the group of young people who she calls the "Re-Generation" <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/erickson/2012/04/the_mobile_re-generation.html">here.</a>

<b> EXCLUSIVE NLT INTERVIEW</b>
<p>
<b>Question: How did your educational trajectory/background affect your current work?</b><br>  

<b>Answer:</b> I have an undergraduate degree in biological sciences and have always loved science and research.  As a result, I focused on working with clients in the pharmaceutical industry when I became a consultant after graduate school (where I got an MBA).  I became fascinated with questions about how to make strategic decisions in an industry that was so heavily influenced by the results of the research pipeline – then with questions about how to strengthen R&D.  I was intrigued by why some companies were more innovative than others and what leaders could do to enhance innovation. 
<p>
My work on innovation led to an interest in collaboration, engagement and, over time, into why people seem to have different expectations for work, which led to a deep dive into understanding the generations.
<p>
My work continues to circle around these issues – how to enhance collaboration, engagement, diversity, and innovation in the workplace, particularly in companies that depend on knowledge-based work.
<p> 
<b>Question: What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?  </b><br>

<b>Answer:</b> As a young consultant, I had the opportunity to work with clients around the world, including major, multi-year engagements in Japan, assignments throughout Europe, and even projects in the Middle East.  This experience gave me a great appreciation of how different organizations work and, most importantly, how I could adapt my style to be most effective in each environment.

I also had an invaluable opportunity to work closely with a firm that Peter Senge had founded, called Innovation Associates, after it was acquired by Arthur D. Little, the consulting firm I had been part of for the first 20 years of my career.  
<p> 
<b>Question: How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>

<b>Answer:</b> The goal of my work is to help people find greater enjoyment and meaning from work – and, as a result, to help organizations have a more engaged and innovative workforce.  Learning is an essential element of this process. 
<p> 
<b>Question: What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>

<b>Answer:</b> People will have and will take increasing responsibility for their own learning.  Learning opportunities will be available in many forms and formats.  
<p> 
<b>Question: What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>

<b>Answer:</b> I’m currently working on two projects:  one is a study of the "next" generation – those under about age 17 today.  I’m calling this group the "Re-Generation" because I believe they will be committed to renewal and conservation of our limited resources.  The second is a study of the old assumptions that still shape our current management practices and ideas about leadership – but that are outdated today.
<p> 
<b>Question: How is the current educational system mismatched to the current job market?  What might we do about this?</b><br>

<b>Answer:</b>  At the most basic level, we are not producing people with skills necessary to fill the new jobs that are being created today.  Our job creation pattern has changed, but our educational patterns have not changed as a result.
