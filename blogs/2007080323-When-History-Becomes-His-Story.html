            When History becomes His Story

“Not to know what happened before you were born is to be forever a child.” Cicero's words, Cicero's logic, but as truthful an adage as has ever been said. I confess myself guilty of not seeking all the knowledge I can get my hands on, a guilt many no doubt share. But what happens when the knowledge we do know, the history we are given, is just that, a story? Do we then spread this false history because it's more attractive and arcane than the simple truth? Is it morally right to present a half-truth as fact under the pretense of unraveling secrets to eager readers?

Take for example Dan Brown's <i><a href=http://www.amazon.com/Angels-Demons-Dan-Brown/dp/0671027360> Angels and Demons </a> </i>, a book I just recently finished reading. It is about a world-wide secret brotherhood of scientists who seek to bring light to the world through science, just as the Church brings light to the world through religion. They call themselves the Illuminati, the Enlightened Ones, and were claimed to be enemies of the Catholic Church since the time of Galileo. At the beginning of this novel, Brown states that all factions and locations referred to in the book are real. After finishing <i>Angels and Demons</i>, I stumbled on a Wikipedia page that spoke of fun facts about the book. Interested, I read on, and reached a section that quite frankly shattered the respect I'd gained for Dan Brown. This section focused on false facts about the book, supposed facts that were so well implemented in the story that a riveted reader wouldn't think twice about believing it. To avoid the risk of spoilers for any future potential readers of Brown's book, let me focus on one misconception only: “Novus Ordo Seculorum.” 

Part of this Latin phrase appears on something we see every day, if we care to look. It is on the one-dollar bill as part of the Great Seal, below the eyed pyramid. Imagine my astonishment when I read Dan Brown's words through his protagonist Robert Langdon: “Novus Ordo Seculorum. It means New Secular Order.” Read that Latin phrase again, and look at the phrase on your dollar bill. Anything different with the words? And when the heroine, Vittoria, a scientist, wondered if he meant ‘secular' as in ‘nonreligious,' he confirmed it, saying that “the phrase not only clearly states the Illuminati objective, but it also blatantly contradicts the phrase beside it. In God We Trust.” Langdon continued to say that that Illuminati sought a New World Order, and that Henry Wallace, vice-president to President Roosevelt, sold the Great Seal design to Roosevelt and told him the phrase translated to “New Deal.” And since Wallace and Roosevelt “were like brothers,” writes Dan Brown in his book, the president simply accepted Wallace's translation and agreed to put this seal on the dollar bill with no idea that he was being manipulated. 

So here Brown ushers into light the idea that the Great Seal was created by a covert ancient brotherhood that has been at war with the Catholic Church since the 1600s, which is to say that the man who actually designed the Great Seal of the U.S. Dollar, Charles Thomson, may have been an Illuminatus. And after Brown adds that the Illuminati were notoriously known for their ability to infiltrate any faction of power — like the Freemasons — captivated readers like me easily fall for the juicy piece of information that has been right in their wallet all along. Not to mention that ‘Seculorum' sounds so much like ‘secular,' despite the fact that it is not on the dollar bill… 

And yet here's something else I found. <a href=http://www.treas.gov/education/faq/currency/portraits.shtml> The U.S. Department of the Treasury </a> writes that “the inscription NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM translates as ‘a new order of the ages,' and signifies a New American era.” To add to this, information on the <a href=http://www.greatseal.com/mottoes/seclorum.html> Great Seal</a> reveals that Thomson himself said the Latin phrase he used symbolizes the new American Era, begun in 1776, which would mean that it had nothing to do with the world, simply with America. Moreover, more digging uncovered that ‘seclorum,' a plural word, refers to ages, centuries, or generations, and thus fits well with the meaning that the founding fathers wanted to instill in the symbolism of this country's Great Seal, that of longevity and the unfinished pyramid of the Great Seal, reaching ever higher. 

A lesson can be learned here, one perhaps known by many but certainly not by all. One must approach new information with skepticism, no matter how attractive or credible the “facts” seem. This may sound naÃ¯ve, but I find it unbelievable that a skilled researcher like Dan Brown — who called upon all his connections to gain his facts for this book and who was interviewed about those facts and confirmed them — would fail to realize that the dollar bill doesn't have “seculorum” on it, or that the Great Seal was adopted by Congress in 1782, not in the 1940s when Henry Wallace served under President Roosevelt. The power of half-truths…
