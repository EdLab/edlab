            By Mary Ehrenworth, the vice director of the TC Reading and Writing Project

1. Talking passionately about books (example book described: <i>The Hunger Games</i> by Suzanne Collins)
Instead of saying the book is good, make specific recommendation/introduction of the book (e.g., personal connection, etc.) Try to reach genres and authors when talking about the book. Further suggestions for teachers: a need to develop passions across genres.

2. Being visible as a reader
Physically carry the books when they are running around.
[Ting's comment: How does this happen? Can we allow students to bring classroom books with them to the dinning room and recess?]

3. Create communities around books (another way to keep readers visible)
E.g., <i>Fox</i> can be read with every grade.

4. Create an online experience: goodreads.com, which can help to make a book club and keep track of books they read. A separate blog entry about Goodreads can be viewed <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/3158">here</a>.  
[Ting's comment: An online book club is a great way to involve parents and students. Students can see what books other peers are reading or have read. The options of leaving comments and keeping track of the books they are reading will be very motivating. It will be interesting to have a comprehensive investigation of the users on the website and specifically see how students interact with their peers through these digital literacy activities.]

5. Seek books (in classroom; another classroom; school libraries; public libraries) — the capability to search for books
[Ting's comment: This will cultivate students' research skills: learn about how to search for information they need and how to utilize potential resources.]

6. Reading across the day — out of school
"We are going to try reading at different places: on the train, sitting in an art museum, in a park, etc." This will help students get a sense about carrying books and reading across the day.
[Ting's comment: This approach will definitely benefit students' life-long learning experience -- Reading can happen anywhere and reading is a joyful experience.]

7. Form book clubs
E.g., every adult at the school leads a book club.
[Ting's comment: How much time and energy does each teacher need to devote for the book clubs?]

8. Parent workshops/book clubs
"Most parents don't know that most children in the country drop two reading levels in the summer because they don't read."
[Ting's comment: This is a good approach to get parents involved in classroom literacy activities and let them be aware of the literacy approaches applied by teachers.]

9. Book clubs that test “hot literature”
A mixture of parents and students will read the books first. They will test that “who will be appropriate to read the books”.
[Ting's comment: It will be very motivating for students who get involved in the "test" group.]

10. Read, read, read and read
If you read, your students will be reading too.

Three essential elements in teaching of reading: Visibility, Passion, Integrity
