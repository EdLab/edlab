Sometimes the most teachable lessons come from a good laugh. In this video set in South Africa, two comedians are asked to talk about humorous experiences they've had that led to learning something new. 
It’s an interesting question to think about and is an unexpected exercise in self-reflection and mindfulness. Plus, it’s a good association to make (humor + learning = memorable moments). <p>

What is it about humor that opens people up to learning? Comedian Robin Banks relays a story that displays the power of a simple joke, where within a matter of seconds, strangers became friends. "Humor goes a long way in changing someone’s state," he says. He’s not wrong about that! <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/14/science/14laughter.html">Evolutionary psychologists have found</a> that laughter produces those sweet, feel-good hormones known as endorphins. On a more social level, laughing together helps form connections and bonds within a group. <p>

A key takeaway for educators here is to consider humor as a way to create environments conducive to learning. Humor can make dull subjects lively, ease tensions, and even lead to <a href="http://mallorcaodyssey.wikispaces.com/file/view/Humor+in+Pedagogy.pdf">increased content retention</a>. Bottom line, if sprinkling some contextual humor into your lessons means the difference between glazed eyes and active minds, crack all the jokes! <p>

Can you recall a time you laughed in class (either as a student or as the educator)? Do you remember what you were learning/teaching at the time? Share your stories in the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/13898">on Vialogues.</a><p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@03:04 MartinPaper: </b>It takes an extroverted person to pull this off! I wonder if most comedians tend to be extroverts?<p>

<b>@04:59 YogiP:</b> My favorite teacher ever was absolutely hilarious. That's largely the reason they were my favorite. It sounds weird to say, but they helped me take a serious course (statistics) less seriously. I stopped worrying about tests as much and just enjoyed the lectures. It was the first (and only) time I did well in a math class!
