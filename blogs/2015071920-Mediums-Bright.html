<p><i>"We will challenge our contributors to uncover what’s working in education—and what others can learn from it. Who are the unlikely education entrepreneurs, and what makes them successful? Where is technology-assisted personalized learning working well, and is it replicable? What are the most noteworthy efforts at closing the achievement gap?"</i> (from <a href="https://medium.com/bright/">Medium’s Bright</a> site)</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/bright/">Medium’s Bright</a> is a pop up publication on education and innovation. Even though it is brand new to the scene, the site is making a name for itself with headlining authors (President Barak Obama, U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, and Academy Award winning actor Matthew McConaughey have all contributed content.) and the endorsement of top-tier educational funding including The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and <a href="http://www.newventurefund.org/">New Venture Fund</a>.</p>

<p><b>Read All About It</b><br>
Bright does not shy away from the hottest, most controversial topics in education policy though the content is focused on sharing positive and hopeful portrayals of education today. Article topics cover inspiring stories like the educational success of a formerly homeless woman, the similarities and differences between teachers and start-up CEOS, the promise of innovations in sex education for boys, and examples of new policies and exciting programs. The mix of articles reveals a strong balance of promoting a positive attitude and fulfilling the information needs of educators.</p>

<p><b>News with a View</b><br>
Editor Sarika Bansal shares that she aims to offer a solutions-oriented lens to education. This means forward-looking, nuanced news featuring a diversity of perspectives. Bright is neither for nor against technology, but rather for breaking stereotypes in an effort to offer a more socially conscious understanding of education. News topics include technology in education, educational experiments with overlooked and underserved populations, first person stories from teachers, articles featuring student perspectives, and reflections on current events. Even Bright’s visual imagery is carefully thought-through and pictures are selected with an eye towards presenting authentic and positive, not canned and dramatized, views of students and teachers. </p>

<p>Looking forward, Bright aims to continue to engage large numbers of followers to write and respond, rather than passively read, Bright’s content. This publication is certain to create a dialogue in the education space.</p>
