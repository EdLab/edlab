            The EdLab Review provides valuable information about new and emerging software teachers could utilize in the classroom.  Instead of only sharing the information with EdLabers and TC professors, Adrienne, Chandler, Max and I are thinking of making the information accessible to everyone via a simple, easy-to-access website!

Our goals are as follows:

EDUCATIONAL GOALS -
-Make EdLab reviews easy to access and viewable by all educators
-Provide teachers with ideas of what software exists and how to use the software effectively in the classroom
-Allow teachers to compare educational software packages
-Increase the use of technology in the classroom, enhancing learning

OTHER GOALS/OBJECTIVES -
-Build relationships with businesses
-Create a revenue stream, funded by business ads
-Increase EdLab's presence and reputation within the state/nation

With those goals and objectives in mind, we put together version one of the EdLab Review website here - http://www.jasonmariasis.com/edlabreview (currently hosted on my domain...).

If you could comment on the following, we'd all greatly appreciate:

1. Is building a site to host EdLab Reviews a good idea? A practical idea?
2. What comments or suggestions do you have on the site's interface? (Changes, additions, more features, layout/design, organization...)
3. What should the site be called - EdLab Reviews (EdLabReviews.com for example) or something different?
4. How would you recommend structuring templates for reviews? As educators, what would you look for in software? Should we create different templates for each category?
5. Should we partner with advertisers to make this site revenue producing?

Based on suggestions from others, we're going to build a forum over the next few days where teachers can discuss the best ways of using the software in their classes.  We also plan on creating an FAQ section.

For front end testing purposes, you can log in and write or comment on reviews with the following credentials - Username: demo Password: demo.  Also feel free to create your own account...you should be able to at this point.

Lastly, if you have suggestions for future EdLab Review topics, please let us know.

Thanks!
