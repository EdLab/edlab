<p><i>"We are working for a world where the Deaf/HoH can communicate with other people spontaneously and effectively–anytime, anywhere." </i> (<a href="http://www.signall.us/">Introducing SignAll</a>) </p>

<p><b>A Solution to a Complex Problem</b></p>

<p>Despite the fact that a hundred million people across the world (more than 1% of the world's population) are unable to hear, there are still a lot of communication barriers facing the deaf community. Not only are there hundreds of sign languages throughout the world, but the components of the language are vast, including not only manual motions, but facial expressions, dynamic use of face, pacing, and body movement. Therefore, conveying meaning to the hearing community poses serious difficulties without a human translator.</p>

<p>This is where SignAll comes in. A spinoff of Hungarian company Dolphio Technologies, SignAll is a startup that believes technology is a key to overcoming the communication barrier between the deaf and the hearing. The SignAll team has developed the world’s first automated sign language translation program, which it hopes will be used in banks, restaurants, and other common, necessary sites of communication between deaf and hearing communities.</p>

<p><b>Using AI to Capture and Translate Movement</b></p>

<p>The SignAll prototype currently utilizes three ordinary web cameras, a depth sensor that tracks hand movement and gestures, and a PC that processes the images in real time. Through computer vision and natural language processing, signs are captured and identified from a set of images representing ASL vocabulary. Then, these images are translated into grammatically correct, fully-formed sentences that appear on the PC screen.</p>

<p>Though SignAll’s system is still in the prototype phase, it already includes a significant amount of an ASL user’s vocabulary, and the tools currently required to use it will become smaller and more accurate over time. The first public pilot of the system is planned for Gallaudet University in D.C., the world’s only liberal arts university for deaf and hard of hearing students, and SignAll plans to partner with companies who are aiming to expand inclusivity in their workplace. With all of the instant translation services available today, perhaps SignAll can finally provide ASL speakers equal opportunity to communicate across language divides.</p>
