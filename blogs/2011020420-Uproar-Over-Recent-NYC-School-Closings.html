            The Panel for Educational Policy has announced their decision to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/nyregion/02panel.html?_r=1&ref=education">close</a> down 14 underperforming public schools in New York City. Members of the panel cite low graduation rates and low attendance as the primary reasons for the closure of these schools. The majority of the schools facing closure are high schools and they are set to be â€œphased out" and replaced with new, usually smaller schools. In general, schools are phased out by not accepting any incoming classes while the new schools begin accepting freshman students. By the time the last graduating class of the old school graduates, all the administrators of the school will be dismissed and thus bringing an end to that particular school. There were initially 24 schools proposed to be shutdown but the panel came to a consensus to close just over half of the proposed schools.
    
Closings like these have become overly common in recent years, especially during the tenure of Mayor Michael Bloomberg. With every passing year though, the reaction to these closings also intensifies. Protests have progressed from being local and unorganized, to uniform and mainstream with the recent protest taking place at the Department of Education's headquarters, which even resulted in some <a href="http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local-beat/Council-Members-Among-Dozens-Arrested-At-School-Shutdown-Protest-114985484.html">arrests</a>. 

There is a common belief shared among these protesters and it's the belief that school officials deliberately set up these schools for closure. The underlined and proposed schools up for closure are known to have some of the <a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/26/schools-chosen-to-close-have-toughest-demographics/?src=tptw">worst</a> performing students, in and out of the classroom. A significant portion of students are either homeless, over-aged or require special education.

Others are also offended that school officials often fail to confront students, teachers, and parents before they propose/decide to close the schools.

The DOE justifies these closings by claiming that the introduction of new schools helps give students the much needed attention that will help them perform better in the long run. Although, for the most part this method has seen some results in improving student performance, it doesn't always guarantee results. In fact, a third of the recently proposed schools set to close were schools that originally replaced other under achieving schools. 

Overall, I feel this is a scheme by the city to reform its school system since student performance on average is far below the national average. Their means of conducting it though can be a bit controversial since it neglects the very individuals affected by it. Instead of giving these schools essentially an ultimatum to fix the school themselves, the city should lent a helping hand to these schools so that they can better attain the preferred standards while at the same time maintaining its integrity.
