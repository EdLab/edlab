          <p>
            These days, most of the talk in education revolves around the quality of teachers and as teacher evaluations are fast becoming one of the major educational policies 
At the end of every semester or term, students rate and grade their teachers base on the teacher's performance. Last week, Mayor Bloomberg proposed a rating system similar to that of the data used to rate restaurants. According to this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/15/nyregion/new-york-issuing-scorecards-on-teacher-colleges.html?ref=education">article</a>, this data is to evaluate and grade teachers graduating from college.

<blockquote>In an effort to shake up institutions that have been criticized as too insular and inert, his administration released scorecards on Wednesday for a dozen teacher-preparation programs in the city. Public and private education schools are being evaluated in various ways, including how many graduates are certified in high-needs areas like special education and whether their teachers have been able to increase student test scores.</blockquote> 

I really believe that this is a great way to analyze teachers before hiring them. When  I was in high school, I wondered how some teachers were hired in the first place. This is not to say that teachers do not know his or her material; he or she knows it but doesn't know how to teach it in order for the students to comprehend. So I believe this method will help NYC schools have the best teachers who will adequately prepare students for the next level of their studies, depending on their previous level.
