<p>Going to the doctor is rarely an enjoyable experience for anyone, but for children in particular, the anxiety and terror associated with such visits can be debilitating. A promising new distraction method has been posed by researchers who tested the feasibility of using virtual reality with pediatric patients to reduce anxiety and pain. While VR technology is typically associated with entertainment, this study proves that it also has immense practical uses.</p>
 
<p>Researchers evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of VR in a clinical setting by conducting a study of children undergoing routine blood draws. The study featured 143 participants, comprised of patients under 18, their caregivers, and phlebotomists. Patients either underwent a blood draw while playing a VR game or normally with general standards of care procedures only. Those undergoing a blood draw with VR played a game featuring a colorful, interactive environment where the player blasted antagonistic bears with cannons directed by the movement of their eyes. Preprocedural and postprocedural surveys asked both patients and caregivers to rate their levels of anxiety, pain, and satisfaction with the blood draw. Additionally, phlebotomists reported on the patient’s experience.</p>
 
<p>The study’s findings revealed that VR significantly reduced acute procedural pain and anxiety in young patients. The children playing the VR game during their blood draw experienced significantly less anxiety and reported lower pain during with the procedure. They also reported high levels of immersion associated with the VR game, demonstrating that it was sufficiently distracting. Patients, caregivers, and phlebotomists reported high levels of satisfaction with the procedure when VR was involved, and would recommend it to other patients. </p>

<p>VR’s success in this study demonstrates that it can be a useful tool in routine procedures like routine blood draws as well as potentially in other, more intense procedures, like painful cancer treatment. The fact that VR headsets have become much more affordable in recent years means that they can be used in clinical settings and beyond. </p>
