<p><a href="http://beta.mural.ly/">Murally</a> is a Pinterest/Prezi mashup that’s more customizable and less complicated than either. It allows users to create a "board" of videos, links, and pictures from around the web and augment the board with notes and organizational structures like storyboards. Meant to be a tool for collaborative sharing in a variety of settings, its unique free-form organization makes it a powerful interdisciplinary contender. Murally’s intuitive interface and touch-ready, tactile experience make it palatable for a wide range of users. The tool has numerous applications in education, presentation, and sharing.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b><br>
The balance between freedom and organization is the magic of Murally. It’s fast and simple as a tool for individual or group brainstorming and the landscape of the board is almost utterly open to the whim of the creator, but Murally also keeps careful track of board evolution. Like Prezi, the tool tracks the floor plan of board development and allows users to quickly adapt their melange into an orderly presentation. That flexibility, coupled with Murally’s ease-of-use and touch screen readiness, opens up the possibility for creation and collaboration for a huge range of ages and experience levels.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b><br>
Murally’s interface is too edgy to be completely smooth. There are a few lags in movement and sizing, but the gestures and navigation seem more natural than most systems available. Murally might want to roll with the idea of absolute power and offer users more developer features like greater control over colors, fonts, and backgrounds.</p>

<p><b>Future Possibilities:</b><br>
Eliminating obstacles to creativity and creating webspace that feels free and flexible is the next evolution of the internet and Murally is a tool that pushes the edge of the curation trend. Though the tool is primarily aimed at work and adult collaboration, it seems like a perfect fit for schools and might be especially effective with younger students more willing to accept the permeability of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXV-yaFmQNk">screen/real life barrier</a>. With the growing computerization of everyday objects and the gradual humanization of computers, Murally may very well be the kind of product this generation demands.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b><br>
Murally is the next generation of collaborative creation.</p>
