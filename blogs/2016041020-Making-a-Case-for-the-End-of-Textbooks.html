<p>Many post-secondary instructors now include open educational resources (OER) as a substitute for pricey textbooks in their classrooms. Increasing the adoption of tablets, smartphones, and laptops in formal learning environments opens up infinite possibilities for deliverable content. Just tap a URL and a new source of learning pops up—and it’s free.</p>
 
<p>A recent overview of research examined the impact of OER in traditional post-secondary educational settings. It compared 16 studies focusing on the relationship between OER implementation and student learning outcomes, and how students and professors perceive this new digital publishing phenomenon. Results are encouraging for cash-strapped, book-burdened students. </p>
 
<p>Although the studies examined varied wildly in sample size, outcome measures, and final results, the author found that students normally achieve the same educational outcomes using OER as they do with traditional textbooks while saving significant amounts of money. Students and faculty are generally positive regarding OER across a diverse range of studies. Students often find they prefer digital textbook content over traditional print materials. Instructors also frequently rate the quality of OER material as being similar to, or better than, offerings in traditional textbooks. Finally, student cost reduction is the major driver for professor choice in open textbook adoption—thank you Professor Populist!  </p>
 
<p>Due to tremendous student debt burdens, tuition increases that consistently exceed prevailing inflation rates, and weak job recovery from the 2008 recession, college students desperately need help staying financially afloat. Because of its obvious relationship to educational costs, this study is particularly encouraging for young students who are debt averse and find the prospect of attending college prohibitively expensive. </p>
 
<p>Future research comparing OER impact across academic disciplines could reveal the times when using digital resources is most effective. Similarly, comparing student academic outcomes when using OER versus traditional textbooks could provide a nuanced perspective on an interesting trend that will only grow in importance. Contrasting cumulative student debt with or without OER could better illustrate the presumed impact on lowering academic costs. Finally, increased efficiency may trump improved learning for all of the results that have been discussed—just because learning is cheaper and more portable doesn’t mean it’s any better. Don’t throw out your book bag just yet. </p>
