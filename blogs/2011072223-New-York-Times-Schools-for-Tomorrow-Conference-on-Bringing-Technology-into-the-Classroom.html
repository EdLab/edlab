            “Nothing stands still. Not the world as a physical entity. Nor the people who inhabit it. Or the students who will eventually lead it”, is the opening line in the mission for the New York Times' Schools for Tomorrow Conference on Bringing Technology Into the Classroom. The dawn of the 21st century and the emergence of Web 2.0 means technology has and continues to play an integral role in how we communicate, share and receive information and learn. With technology becoming an ever stronger presence in our schools, many questions and concerns have risen about how to effectively use technology in the classroom. And what is a more effective way to address such a question than conference in the city home to the largest school system in the nation.

On September 22nd, “education takes the center stage” at the New York Times' Schools for Tomorrow Conference on Bringing Technology into the Classroom. The conference will bring together school boards, principals, innovative teaching professionals, hedge fund investors, philanthropists, and government officials.

The conference is open to the general public but only 400 seats are available. Having interned here at the EdLab the past two summers, I am aware that one of its primary missions is to develop and support emerging technologies in education (Vialogues, Pressible, etc) and so I think it will be great if EdLabbers <a href="http://events.mediactive-events.com/NYTSFT2011_upd/form.php">register</a> to attend the conference to learn and also share their work.
