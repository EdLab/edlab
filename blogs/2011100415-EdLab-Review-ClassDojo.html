Journeying through the technosphere, I found this nifty little app called <a href="http://www.classdojo.com/">ClassDojo</a>, built to aid teachers in classroom management.  It fits right in with my new enthusiasm for quick and dirty quantification, and so I thought I'd highlight it here.
<!--break-->
<b>Description</b>:
Teachers put all their students up on the ClassDojo website, sorted by class, and then continually adjust throughout the day student's ratings on the site by giving them positive or negative awards (such as “-1 for interrupting,” although the specific content is up to the teacher).  Each student has a running tally, which adds up all the positive and negative awards to give him or her a number indicating how well he or she is doing. 

<b>Pros</b>:
The ideal use-case the creators of the program seem to have in mind is that the class-rankings are displayed via projector, and that the teacher continually updates them using a smartphone linkup (which they provide).  This provides a useful and automatic way of encouraging and discouraging different student behaviors without having to interrupt the class to do so.  The interface is simple and attractive, more appropriate, probably, for middle or grade school than high school.  The program also offers a page where you can select, from among a variety of options, which new feature you'd like to see next.  

<b>Cons</b>:
The program, apparently still being developed, is a little bare bones, and certainly I look forward to a future iteration in which student behavior over time can be tracked, to give the teacher an idea of what direction the student is headed.  Furthermore, I can also imagine a future in which a program like this is integrated with a homework tracker, grade tracker, etc., so as to provide one complete report card for teachers, parents, or students to view when they want to know about how someone is doing in school.

<b>Our Takeaway</b>:
ClassDojo gets the job done, and I think that's the most important question when it comes to new educational technology.  That said, I'm interested in where they go from here about as much as I am in what they've already done.

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>:
One specific idea I think we should borrow from them is giving users a few options for future improvements and asking them which they would like.  This way you get more feedback, and more structured feedback, than simply asking people what they think.
