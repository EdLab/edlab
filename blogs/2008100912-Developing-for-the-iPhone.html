            So I bought the bullet and purchased the iPhone developer kit.  In my spare time (which is pretty much nil between trying to write a dissertation, working full-time, doing consulting, and trying to have a life), I have been interested in developing location-based social networking application for the gay community for the iPhone.  Location-based social networking is somewhat in vogue and many applications that are trying to do this are being developed (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/28/the-state-of-location-based-social-networking-on-the-iphone/">read more from Tech Crunch</a>).  Social networking sites are widely used by gay men and women for dating and the like.  I have also noticed how many gay people were on these new location-based social networks, such as <a href="http://www.loopt.com/">Loopt</a>.  However, it seems to me that the gay community would rather "segment" their dating life from other social networking they may do.  For example, commentators have noted how people's parents (or brothers, sisters) have "Friended" them, and then have privy information into their social life.  People then end up having to "scrub", or severely limit, their social networking profiles.  If location-based social networking takes off, many people might not want their dating life to intersect too much with the rest of their life (e.g., you don't want everyone you know to know you are a HO).  A couple friends said they would try it out and be my test subjects.  

Anyways, the upside for the EdLab is that I should have should be acquiring some iPhone development skills that could be transferable to EdLab projects.  Is there an educational killer app for the iPhone that should be developed?  When I start thinking about it, I always end up with ideas that don't really leverage the affordances of the iPhone (e.g., things that can already be done with a webpage).  So the question is, is there an EdLab killer iPhone app?   I am open to suggestions.
