Continuing the get to know you series, this week we learn more about Melissa.  She has been working at Gottesman since February 2010, and lives in Queens, and if you've read any of her <a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/melissac/the-first-childrens-book">wonderful </a>and <a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/melissac/reading-banned-books-out-loud">fascinating</a> Pressible posts, you may already know that she was a teacher and that she is currently a library intern here at Gottesman as she pursues an MLIS at Queens College.  Today, however, you'll get a chance to learn a little bit more about this Brooklyn/New Jersey native.

<div>

<em>A sport you enjoy playing (or watching)? </em>Baseball. I am an avid <a href="http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=nym">Mets</a> fan despite their valiant efforts to make me stop rooting for them.

What do you remember about your first day of school?

</div>
<div>

My awesome <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Care-Bears-Checkered-Tin-Lunch/dp/B00410JI80/ref=sr_1_cc_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1289333231&amp;sr=1-3-catcorr">Care Bears lunch box</a> and matching thermos.

</div>
<em>What did you want to be when you grew up?</em>

</div>
<div>

1st a gymnast. 2nd a fashion designer. I sprained my ankle on the vault and that was the end of my gymnastics career. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerri_Strug">Who knew a sprain could hurt so badly</a>? I learned at a young age that the athletic life was just not for me. ) I studied fashion for a bit and realized I wasn't driven or talented enough for a career in that either. After I graduated from college, I became a teacher which was fantastically difficult as well but definitely more up my alley.

</div>
<div>

<em>What  was your first job?</em>

</div>
<div>

I was a <a href="http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos117.htm">clerk</a> at Community Video, a small video store in my <a href="http://www.vernontwp.com/">hometown</a>.  I got to create displays, chat with people, watch movies and eat gumballs. It was the best first job ever.

</div>
<div>

<em>What has been your worst job?</em>

</div>
<div>

Where to start? ...nightclub door person? boot maintenance at a ski lodge? foot model?

</div>
<div>

<em><span style="font-style: normal"> </span>What has been your best job?</em>

</div>
<div>

I love working here at the library. I also used to volunteer as a personal shopper at <a href="http://www.dressforsuccess.org/">Dress for Success</a>. That was a great experience.

<em><a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2010/11/hammocks-at-gantry.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4633" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2010/11/hammocks-at-gantry-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>...Things to do at the  library?</em>

</div>
<div>

Fix the printer...just kidding. I love helping students find what they are looking for, especially the more obscure requests.

</div>
<div>

<em>...Best places to read?</em>

</div>
<div>

<a href="http://nysparks.state.ny.us/parks/149/details.aspx">Gantry Park </a>in Long Island City. They have hammocks in the summer and you can read in the sun facing the midtown skyline. It's pretty amazing.

</div>
<div>

<em>... Favorite authors or books?</em>

</div>
<div>

Too hard! I will say I'm currently reading David Sedaris's latest book <em><a href="http://clio.cul.columbia.edu:7018/vwebv/holdingsInfo?searchId=29663&amp;recCount=50&amp;recPointer=3&amp;bibId=8109307">Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk</a></em> and it's pretty entertaining.

</div>
<div>

<em>The most amazing thing I've ever seen was</em>....the Grand Canyon.

</div>
<div>

<em>Most fascinating person I've ever met was</em>... my husband. Oh and this guy who just spent the last 1000 days at sea. He docked at this bar in Queens and told us a bit about his story.
