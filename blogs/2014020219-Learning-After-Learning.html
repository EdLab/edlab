<b>Title:</b> Does individual or collaborative self-debriefing better enhance learning from games?
<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Hans van der Meij, Henny Leemkuil, & Juo-Lan Li
<p>
<b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563213001933">Computers in Human Behavior</a>
<p>
<b> Research Question:</b> Does self-debriefing successfully scaffold learning from games?
<p>
<b>Study Design:</b> 
Even after the learning benefits of a particular game or game-based tool have been demonstrated, there’s still plenty more one would like to know. One potentially beneficial avenue for exploration is scaffolding via "debriefing," which the authors of this study define as "facilitated or guided reflection in the cycle of experiential learning."
<p>
For this study, a group of 45 Taiwanese high school students played Lemonade Tycoon Deluxe, a game that involves the creation and maintenance of a lemonade business. After they played the game and were tested on related knowledge, the students were divided into two groups. The fifteen students in the first group were each individually debriefed on their experience with the game. The thirty students in the second group were debriefed in pairs on their experience with the game. To see whether the debriefing resulted in increased learning, all students then played the game for another session and were tested again afterwards.
<p>
<b>Findings:</b>
Over time the students did improve at the game, with both groups seeing similar gains in proficiency. With regard to the post-game tests, both groups again saw improvement, although the individually debriefed students saw greater improvement on their test scores than the students debriefed in pairs.
<p>
<b>Moving Forward:</b>
Unfortunately, the authors did not produce a group without self-debriefing for comparison purposes, and therefore this study can’t tell us much about how much of an improvement we might see in an activity by adding a self-debriefing segment. That said, it is interesting to note that individual self-debriefing was more effective, indicating that providing more opportunities for individualized self-reflection in general may be a worthwhile schooling technique. Future researchers might investigate just when and where this self-debriefing might come in handy, including in situations beyond gaming.
