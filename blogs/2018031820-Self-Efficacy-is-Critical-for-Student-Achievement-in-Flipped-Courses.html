<p>A typical flipped classroom aims to maximize face-to-face in-class time and enable personalized feedback through a combination of pre-class internet-based individual learning, and in-class interactive group learning. The model gives students control of the pace and process for learning.
 
<p>In a flipped classroom, knowing how to regulate time, resources, and strategies to achieve learning goals is important. Research shows that students with higher levels of self-regulation tend to learn more effectively and achieve better in a flipped classroom than those with lower levels of self-regulation. Yet studies that compared the effectiveness of flipped classes with traditional face-to-face instruction have yielded mixed findings, largely because of the variability in the design and implementation of flipped classrooms. In an attempt to uncover the nature of flipped classrooms and describe how students learn in this context, this study examined the relationships between three self-regulatory constructs: prior domain knowledge, self-efficacy, and the use of learning strategies and academic achievement in both the pre-class and in-class learning environments of flipped math courses.</p>
 
<p>The cohort comprised 151 undergraduate students from 16 flipped sections of Calculus I and II courses at a large Midwestern university. Participants were an even distribution of male (47.9%) and female (52.1%); more than two thirds (68.9%) white, one fourth (25.2%) Asian, with the remainder from other ethnic backgrounds; and 85% freshman and sophomores, with juniors and seniors making up the rest.</p>

<p>The results revealed that students who were more self-efficacious were more likely to achieve at higher levels in both the pre-class and in-class environments; and that teachers could help students build confidence and belief in their ability to succeed in math. Researchers suggest that in pre-class activities, teachers should select and structure the online lectures, learning tasks, and assignments in ways that are suitable for the development of students' mathematic reasoning. This way, students experience small successes early in the course, which help them develop confidence to tackle advanced topics later. Further, teachers should show their virtual presence by providing immediate feedback to questions, sending reminders with guiding instructions, and creating mechanisms to assist students' understanding.</p>
