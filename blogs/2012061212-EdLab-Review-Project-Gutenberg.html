<a href=”www.gutenberg.org”>Project Gutenburg</a> consists of over 40,000 texts in 61 languages and is provided for free in a variety of formats. It is available in desktop and mobile versions. 

<b>Pros:</b> 
The pros of Project Gutenberg (PG) are pretty much apparent the second you read the description above. The texts are available in several formats, including basic HTML, Unicode Text (.txt), the open-source ePub format, and Kindle format without need to register for the service. The main focus of PG is providing texts in such a way that they can be opened by virtually any device in some way for perpetuity. The site is also available in a mobile version, allowing on-the-go readers to access texts that can be read on virtually all devices.

<b>Cons:</b>
I should give the PG Team some slack, as it is an all-volunteer project that subsists on donations. However, there are some concerns with using PG that should probably be pointed out:

<li>The collection of texts included in PG are confined in two ways: the choices of the volunteers (some works may not be in PG simply because no one's volunteered to add them yet) and copyright law (PG only includes works that are considered public domain in the United States or works where the copyright holder has given PG permission to include their works).</li>
<li>The interface is anything but intuitive. Browsing the collection is difficult and clicking the search link doesn't bring you to an actual search page. There is a search bar present on the far right side of the page which is a simple keyword search, but there is no advanced search feature.
<img src="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/files/gutenberg_ss2.jpg" width="500" height="109"/></li>
<li>Due to the nature of PG, there is a lack of information relating to particular editions. (Some edition information can be found in the bibrecord tab for each item, or the item itself depending on the format downloaded.) While leisure readers may not give the particulars of an edition a second thought, teachers (and their students) may wish to use an edition that isn't available on PG for any number of reasons.</li>


<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> 
With its large collection of public domain texts, Project Gutenberg can be an asset to students and teachers that wish to explore the classics of literature or historical texts. Because a variety of formats are available, an entire class of students (each with their own devices, be it a mobile phone, tablet, eReader, laptop, or desktop) can access the same information digitally. While there are inherent problems in that approach (e.g. in a classroom discussion, how do you make sure everyone's in the same point in the text without page or reference numbers?), the portability outweighs many of the downsides found in the site's physical presence. 

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
A great resource for readers to access classic texts free and fast; not so great for readers who prefer more modern texts.
