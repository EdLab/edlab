            As I eagerly await my first time as a voter in next year's general elections, one of the things that have always baffled me is the Electoral College during presidential elections. In most nations, the candidate with the most overall votes is the winner but in the US, the Electoral College decides who win presidential elections. 

What exactly is the Electoral College?

Electors who are appointed by each state and formally elect the President and Vice President of the United States is what the Electoral College is made up of. Every State has a different number of electors. The number is determined by the total number of representatives and senators a state has in Congress. During the Constitutional Convention, there were different possible ways to choose a president. One of the ideas was to make Congress decide but that option was rejected mainly because the balance of power in the government could have been affected. Another idea was to make state legislatures elect the president but for fear of losing the idea of federation, it was rejected. An indirect election, which is the Electoral College as opposed to a direct election by the citizens, was rather favored for fear that the people would be biased and choose a favorite who comes from their own region, preventing the president to emerge a winner due to popular majority.
 
The framers of the Constitution, during the Constitutional Convention through a “committee of eleven” proposed the idea of the Electoral College. Each elector can cast one vote for the President and another for the Vice President. The citizens in each state who vote are instructing electors who will be pledged to vote for the same candidate as the majority of the state did. This is an indirect way of choosing a president, “the candidate who wins the popular vote in a state wins all the pledged votes of the state's electors.” The Electoral College system was established by Article II of the Constitution and amended by the 12th amendment in 1804.
 
Today, the Electoral College system is still in use, which is of so much importance because the President is elected based on a distribution of popular support by the citizens. It also contributes to the political stability of the nation as it encourages a two-party system and maintains a federal system of government and representation.
