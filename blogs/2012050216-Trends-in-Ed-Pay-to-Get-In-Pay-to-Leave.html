            A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/30/education/parents-owe-full-tuition-after-withdrawing-children-from-private-schools.html?ref=education">recent article</a> from the New York Times depicts the consequences of trying to remove your child from a private school. The article describes two scenarios where parents had to pull their children out of private school. The first was because the parents could not afford the school; the second was because the family was moving to a different city. Both scenarios had the same response from the private school when the parents tried to remove their children: they were told that they had to pay the remaining tuition for the rest of the year. The parents had expected that they would lose their deposits&mdash; they didn't consider the possibility that they would end up <i>owing</i> the schools, despite the fact that their children would no longer be receiving an education from their institution. In both situations, the parents and the private school battled in court and the parents did not have to pay the tuition.

So there's a moral to this story... if you're going to enroll your child into private school, make sure to keep them there. Private schools are sort of like the mob where you can get in, but it's hard to get out. Parents should be aware of this and they should always read their contracts and assume that the school will enforce the terms at all times. Though, it should be noted that private schools enforce the contract for a reason: to prevent parents from quickly switching between schools. If a child drops out of a private school, tuition money, which would go towards paying teachers and running the school, is lost. Even so, sometimes events happen that are out of the parents' control. Even in those circumstances, should private schools still force parents to pay for education their child will never receive?
