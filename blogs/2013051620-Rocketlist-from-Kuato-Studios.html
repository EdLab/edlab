<i>The core focus of Rocketlist is the videos. We hope this will help to engage kids and inspire them around the decisions they will make for their future.  We interview creative problem solvers, in all different types of roles – scientists, programmers, marketers. While they may have very different jobs, they all have been able to marry their passion and skills to solve problems in new ways and work on issues they care about</i> (<a href="http://www.kuatostudios.com">Kuato Studios</a>).
  <p> <b>3, 2, 1... Passion!</b><br> At first glance, <a href="http://www.rocketlist.me/">Rocketlist</a> seems like a rather simple, light-weight platform to help young people find video-based career inspiration.  However, the site’s creators, <a href="http://www.kuatostudios.com/index.html">Kuato Studios</a>, a self-proclaimed group of "problem solvers and trouble-makers" (backed by <a href="http://www.sri.com/engage/ventures">SRI International</a> and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/horizons-ventures">Horizons Ventures</a>) hopes to provide the real-world resources and "connection points" to help high schoolers discover a more meaningful, if unconventional career path.  Long story short.  This is not your mother’s guidance counselor.  Instead, the site hosts short (about 3 minutes long), original video interviews featuring individuals in a wide variety of fields, ranging from engineering to storytelling.  Interviewees share how they discovered and gained the skills necessary to succeed in their current careers.  These videos are then paired with a list of suggested online and in-person resources needed to take a nontraditional path to enter and explore these fields.  Jake Samuelson, one of Kuato’s business development team members describes the group’s inspiration (see exclusive NLT interview with Jake below), "We thought there was a gap in knowledge of what these skills could mean in the real world in awesome careers. We thought a few powerful examples could go a long way, so last summer we started finding a list of amazing designers, developers, entrepreneurs and just asked them to tell their stories!"   
<p>
<b>Curating a career</b><br> Online resources to help learners of all stripes make choices about which college to attend abound (check out Noodle.org as one recent example).  However, where Rocketlist provides additional value is in helping identify the growing body of <a href="http://www.uncollege.org/">"UnCollege"</a> and skills-based learning opportunities available to support people who want to jump right into a field and self-credential as opposed to pursuing a traditional degree.  Also, instead of strictly following the massively popular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOC model</a> or a set of online lessons in the style of <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> (both are represented in the lists of Rocketlist resources), the Rocketlist platform acts as a potential catalyst helping young people to discover and direct their energies towards a subject or field.  It is interesting to note that many of these fields are emergent and easily accessible information on what is involved and how you gain access is still scarce.  In addition, unlike popular college search engines Rocketlist reinforces this discovery stage and might ultimately help learners to avoid investing time and money in a field they aren’t truly interested in.  As student loan debt continues to <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-09-06/student-loans-debt-for-life">billow out of control</a> this concept of investing time in additional exploration BEFORE taking-on the growing cost of higher education, should only grow in relevance and value.  <p> 
<b>Millennials will have multiple "best-fits"</b> <br>In the current climate of test-based assessment and <a href="http://educationnext.org/tracking-improve-learning/">"tracking"</a> many young people are led down a path that, if <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/27/us-attn-andrea-education-dropouts-idUSBRE82Q0Y120120327">college dropout and transfer rates</a> are any indication, doesn’t fit their desired career (or in the case of Millennials, multiple career) endgame(s).  After all, careers for Millennials are much less about finding one job to last a lifetime, and instead, as <a href="http://www.careeradvisoryboard.org/public/uploads/2011/10/Future-of-Millennial-Careers-Report.pdf">this recent study from the Career Advisory Board points out</a>, more focused on following a multi-pathed trajectory.  To reinforce this, many of the interviewees Kuato picked are young, <a href="http://www.thereformedbroker.com/2012/03/12/the-coming-wave-of-black-collar-workers/">"black-collar"</a> professionals representative of the career and worker of the coming "<a href="http://davidhoule.com/shiftstore/Entering-the-Shift-Age/complete-Book-Entering-the-Shift-Age/complete-Book-Entering-the-Shift-Age.html">Shift Age</a>."  Regardless, unless your local high school guidance counselor is a young, hip designer, <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/my-generation-2011-10/">many Millennials</a> may feel more at home with a Rocketlist set of resources than the "business as usual" career and college advice found at their local school.  Perhaps Rocketlist, in addition to inspiring new career pathways will inspire educational institutions to reimagine the guidance counselor of the future?       <p> <b>Exclusive NLT Interview with Rocketlist & Kuato Studios Business Development team member, Jake Samuelson:</b><p>  <b>Rocketlist seems to have a refreshing emphasis on helping young people to gain skills, passion for and insight into real-world careers. What was the inspiration for this focus?</b><br>   In the first months of starting the company, founder Frank Meehan and chief learning officer David Miller went to schools to ask students what they wanted to learn – what skills, what subjects – and what they wanted to do when they grew up. This feedback led the team to develop its first learning products to teach coding, science, and design in a new way.  In extensive interviews with teenagers, we found that many of them wanted to understand the connections, skills and paths that people took to become successful today.  We thought there was a gap in knowledge of what these skills could mean in the real world in awesome careers. We thought a few powerful examples could go a long way, so last summer we started finding a list of amazing designers, developers, entrepreneurs and just asked them to tell their stories! We asked subjects to talk about the decisions they made and the skills they learned as teenagers, which is especially relevant to our audience. <p> <b>What additional "connection points" does the site recommend & provide? What will it provide in the future?</b><br>  The core focus of Rocketlist is the videos. We hope this will help to engage kids and inspire them around the decisions they will make for their future.  We interview creative problem solvers, in all different types of roles – scientists, programmers, marketers. While they may have very different jobs, they all have been able to marry their passion and skills to solve problems in new ways and work on issues they care about.  We hope kids who watch this and get a better sense of where their skills and passion can take them – we try not to be too prescriptive. We do try to also show how much hustle and curiosity plays a part in being successful.  In terms of connection points, we have started to provide some "get started" resources for those interested in science, design, and coding. There is so much great – and free – content out there, that we try to play a curation role and highlight some tools that we think are great for getting started with these skills.  In the future, we hope to add more interactive challenges around these skills, and opportunities for students to share projects they are working on. We are talking with a few groups about collaborating for these challenges, so stay tuned. <p> <b>Do you think that Rocketlist could provide a complement to traditional High School guidance counselors? Replacement?</b><br>  I definitely do not think it’s a replacement. Good guidance counselors who care about their students and help guide them to reach their potential with support and resources, is something quite different and complementary. Similarly, I think our efforts are complementary to some amazing mentorship and apprenticeship programs I’ve been a part of. There is nothing better than a mentor – especially someone who went through similar experiences to you – to give targeted advice and support you in hard choices growing up.  What I think this project does add is exposing kids to new ideas and careers, and tangibly seeing where skills in design, coding, problem solving, science, etc. can take you. I didn’t know many scientists, or product designers, or entrepreneurs, growing up, but I think their stories would have helped inspire me and given me a better sense of what I wanted to work on and develop. <p> <b>Why would a design studio want to provide these services? What do you gain and offer?</b><br>  At the heart of our company, we want to play our small part in helping the next generation's scientists, engineers, and creators find their path. We have a team of designers, developers, educators, animators who all care deeply about this mission and helping make education more engaging for today’s students.  We focus on skills in the videos that we also hope to teach in our products – and that kids have told us THEY WANT to learn. We think by learning these skills and design thinking at an early age – you are really developing the closest thing to super powers in today’s world. If we can inspire more kids to get excited about science, coding, etc. we build our market.  We also have found this content to be a great magnet for inspiring teachers and kids that we want to hear from and work with. Work like this helps us be part of the conversation with creative kids and educators, and listen carefully to what they want.  <p> <b>What is your goal for the project in the next 6 months?</b><br>  Our next focus is really on building on the interviews, and letting more people tell their story. We want a more diverse population by race, gender, background, and profession. As I said before, we also want to build out more tools to help kids get from inspiration to action.  Also, Kuato Studios, the parent company to Rocketlist, will be launching its first products this March and May. The first two products out will be video games for the iPad that teach some of the skills featured in the Rocketlist videos – coding, design, animation, science. It will be fun to create a connection between the skills people talk about on Rocketlist and the skills being taught in the games. <p> <b>Do you think the platform could be a part of the "UnCollege" movement and help direct young people towards the resources necessary to skip college and "self-credential?"</b><br>  I love that there is a big movement changing the notion that college is the only path to success. College is a great path for a lot of people, but not for everyone.  What I think we really have in common with this movement is the notion that you should be in charge of your own learning. Learning doesn’t need to start and end with the school day, and you don’t have to go to college to be successful.  It is amazing there are new models to show competency and skill, beyond the traditional diploma system, that can be messy signals. I think new platforms will open up a lot of opportunity for people around the world. We also want to play our part, and working in our products for students to demonstrate mastery on concepts in alternative ways. The next five years should be fun.
