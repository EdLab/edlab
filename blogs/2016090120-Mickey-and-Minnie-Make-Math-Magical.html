<p>Math may not be every child’s idea of fun, so <a href=" https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mickeys-magical-math-world/id925134465?mt=8 ">Mickey's Magical Math World</a> enlists Disney’s brightest animated stars in futuristic adventures to get your kid counting.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Mickey's Magical Math World offers a variety of math games for newbies. Kids choose from five modules: Counting, Add and Subtract, Shapes, Numbers, and Sort and Match. Game play is first rate. In Counting, Minnie Mouse and her squeaky-jointed robot friend invite you to count mini oil cans to make her mechanical friend move smoothly. Just drag and drop the correct number of mini cans into the big oil can and your robot squeals with delight. </p>

<p>Math World is a Disney production, so you know your child will experience the best in multimedia magic. The interface pops with pretty colors, delights with smartly designed sets, shines with smooth animations, and is populated with charismatic characters. Mickey, Minnie, Daffy, and the rest of the cast are expressive and inviting, and the music packs pep to keep game play moving. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Mickey's Magical Math World is an absolute delight to play; however, there were a couple of annoying quirks. Loading time between games takes longer than you would expect, putting pause to play. </p>

<p>Also, the Dispatch Dock rocket game was finicky. It asks you to plop down a specific number of riders safely on their seats before shooting off into outer space. Given that the app is intended for tots with less than graceful fine motor skills, I can only imagine how frustrating it would be for them to complete this game given my own struggles. Finally, some modules were unintuitive to play and objectives were unclear. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Mickey's Magical Math World is a fab app that will appeal to Disney’s fervent fan base and youngsters who just like fun games. Besides a few aesthetic quibbles, Math World will push your child to learn math in exciting new ways. Unfortunately, as seems to be the trend, full functionality isn’t free. Parents, be prepared to pull out your credit card to help your young math adventurers reach the furthest orbits of math learning. </p>
