<i>The Whiteboard Reinvented- Visualize, Explore, Collaborate</i>

Provided by Dabbleboard, Inc., Dabbleboard is a  an online collaboration application that's centered around the whiteboard using a robust drawing interface.
 
<b><a href="http://dabbleboard.com/ ">dabbleboard.com </a></b>

<b>Price:</b> Dabbleboard offers both a free and pro version of its application. Detailed information on pricing is available <a href="https://www.dabbleboard.com/pro">here</a>.

<b>How it works:</b> Dabbleboard can automatically detect basic shapes, as well as allow users to draw freehand. The application has a drag and drop library that is user-generated from past drawings, and basic features such as insert text, undo, redo, and reuse. 

<b>Prop points:</b> The drawings <a href="http://www.dabbleboard.com/toolkits ">toolkit</a> includes categories for flowchart, organization chart, network diagram, mindmap, EE diagram, user interface mockup, floorplan, comics, sports play and movement. These functions enable users to more easily express what they think within commonly used schemas. Also, Dabbleboard has a <a href="http://www.getsatisfaction.com/dabbleboard">user forum</a> where users can ask questions, debug drawings, share ideas, report problems, and rate the application; as well as a <a href="http://blog.dabbleboard.com/">blog</a> where users can receive the latest information from the Dabbleboard development team about feature enhancements, future development plans, and scheduled downtimes. The collaboration features include a sidebar which allows video, chatting, and sharing drawings with others.

<b>Drop points:</b> The free version of Dabbleboard has limited functionality in comparison with the pro version. For example, there are limitations on storage for documents and images, limited data portability, the customization functionality is restricted, and customer support is downgraded. Users with free accounts can only download and save their drawings as png files, as opposed to pro accounts which can also be downloaded SVG files and opened with Microsoft Visio, Adobe Illustrator, etc. Another drawback of this application is that a user can only upload one document at a time into the application, not multiple documents. With regards to privacy, currently the user can choose whether he or she wishes to publish the drawings to the web, however this issue is under debate as a potential "pro-only" feature according to the Dabbleboard blog.

<b>Final score: </b> This is a good whiteboarding tool for brainstorming and collaboration, both inside the classroom, and in the workplace. The chat and video features coupled with the diverse library and toolkit structures make this a robust visualization tool. The free version has limitations as compared to the pro version, however even with limited functionality, it will still meet the needs of classroom and workplace problem solving through visualization methods.

<b>Recommended uses:</b> As compared to physical whiteboards, this interactive whiteboard application allows users to share ideas remotely and create digital artifacts of their brainstorming activities, to be shared and critiqued with others in real-time or at a later date.
