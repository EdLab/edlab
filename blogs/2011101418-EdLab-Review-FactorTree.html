Normally at EdLab we like to review good products, even if flawed, that the public ought to know about. Consider this your abby normal EdLab Review. 

<b>Description:</b> Factor Tree is supposed to be an application that helps teach math to self-motivated learners who want self-paced teaching and the opportunity to master concepts...wait a second...that sounds like <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">another site I've already used</a>. And wait a minute...I've seen <a href="http://certificationmap.com/wp-content/uploads/Khan-Academy-logo.png">that logo before</a>. Factor Tree claims to be adaptive and has an accurate "progression algorithm." They have an innovative approach to teaching math where East meets West (essentially practice plus understanding). They have statistics and parental notifications and much much more!
Yet when you use the site, it becomes obvious that this site is a sad imitation of Khan Academy, except that KA has more features and plenty of video content to work off of. There are plenty of bugs that prevent the user from completing a worksheet or an evaluation test. The bugs propagate into the parental notifications (e.g. I couldn't complete a worksheet because the submit button did not work...then I received the parent notification that said I couldn't get a single problem right and that I was significantly struggling with math). I wouldn't mind the bugs if FactorTree had something impressive and original. The problem is that FactorTree is a cheap copy of existing adaptive learning and self-paced educational applications. I don't mind the unoriginal "East meets West" teaching philosophy if they had research and good evidence to back up their claims about the efficacy of their learning approach. The biggest problem with this site is that it serves no audience. The site seeks to cater to self-motivated learners who want self-paced direction, yet there are so many sites that do a better job of catering to this audience than FactorTree. The only nice thing I can say about FactorTree is that the outer shell of the site is pretty and misleading enough to draw in new users.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> This is a good example of how learning and technology can lead to absolutely no synergy if not properly thought through. FactorTree doesn't do a single thing better than most other existing math applications. It's important to keep in mind what distinguishes your application from the rest and develop a "core of awesome"
