          <p>
            This weekend I tried (and failed) to get tickets for the Shakespeare in the Park's production of Much Ado About Nothing, so I thought I'd tell everyone about the <a href="http://www.publictheater.org/en/About/About-The-Public/" target = "blank">Public Theater program</a>. If you're new to New York City, you might have heard of Shakespeare in the Park. Basically, it is a non-profit theater company that puts on high quality shows in Central Park's Delacorte Theater for free. The company was founded by Joseph Papp in 1962 and has been producing a variety of shows with the intent of serving "as an advocate for the theater as an essential cultural force in leading and framing dialogue on important issues of our day."  

What this ultimately means is that, you can watch a wonderful Broadway caliber show in the unique setting that is the Delacorte Theater for free. However, there is a price. The process of distributing free tickets happens in a cruelly fair way. Tickets are distributed at noon, and whoever is lined up will receive tickets until they run out. The tickets are for the performance the night of distribution and the lines get quite long. So long, in fact, that you have to get to the park around 6:30 A.M. to be in a pretty good position to get tickets. There is to be no cutting or cheating your way through this line, as the Public Theater Company has people monitoring the line and will kick out cheaters. For those willing to sacrifice  half of their day, I suggest bringing something to sit on, some food and a friend (or at least some form of entertainment). Amusingly, several places actually deliver food to the Shakespeare in the Park line. Don't worry, though. The shows are always worth it. I've been to their productions of Into the Woods and Love's Labour's Lost and left stunned.
