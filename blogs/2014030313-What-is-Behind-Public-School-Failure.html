            For the past three decades, it seems our nation's educators have bear the brunt of the outcry about “failing schools.” Educators, once praised and hailed as heroes, have essentially become villains and scapegoats for our “failing schools.” But is this really the case? The start of the outcry about failing schools coincided with the rise of the charter school system (i.e. privatization of our nation's public schools.) Additionally, successive administrations have implemented educational standards where teachers are held accountable for failing students and schools, based on the scores of standardized exams.
 
In this <a herf="http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/education-uprising/the-myth-behind-public-school-failure">article</a>, the author argues that standardized testing, vouchers and and charter schools essentially amount to a corporate takeover of our public schools. When the landmark educational report, “A Nation at Risk” was issued in 1983, the outcry from all corners of American life was loud. However, the author notes A Nation was “remarkably free of facts and solid data.” A subsequent and less known report, “Sandia Report,” argued that the failing test scores highlighted in a Nation at Risk, was really down the increase in the number of students taking exams and not actually the test scores. Additionally, their large teacher unions means educators lack accountability and the bad ones stay in the classroom.
 
Our “failing schools” have since become a battle cry for corporate interest in our public schools. President Bush's No Child Left Behind Act and the current administration's Race to the Top initiative (both ties public school funding to test scores) have made companies such as Pearson (textbooks and exams) very rich and have used the scores to close down public schools in the name of charters. However, there has been a moving resistance away from standardized testing as a true (and some might say only) indicator of student and school progress. The author cites a Seattle area high school where teachers refused to administer a standardized exam. The school district eventually reneged on their threats of retaliation and high schools there were informed the exam was no longer mandatory. It led to a nationwide debate on “reform” and what the author calls not an “education crisis but a manufactured catastrophe.”
 
According to the author, the formula used by “reformists” is simple:
<blockquote>
 Underfund schools. Overcrowd classrooms. Mandate standardized tests sold by private-sector firms that “prove” these schools are failures. Blame teachers and their unions for awful test scores. In the bargain, weaken those unions, the largest labor organizations remaining in the United States. Push nonunion, profit-oriented charter schools as a solution.
</blockquote>

Do you agree with the argument of the author? Are our public schools really failing? Is privatization the wrong avenue to transform our public schools? What role, if any, should standardized testing play?
