<i>Innovation in education is not limited to one type of school. Innovations take place every day in every type of school — district, private and charter — and we can learn from them all. </i>(<a href="http://www.odysseyinitiative.org/">The  Odyssey Initiative site</a>)

<p>
<b>Taking Teaching on the Road </b>
<p>
The Odyssey Initiative, which is described as a "journalism project" aims to succeed where only rock bands and young people have traditionally gone before... on a road trip.  Three educators and a documentary filmmaker will set-out on a year-long mission to record and share best teaching practices from a wide-range of schools, from parochial to public, in the 50 states. Beyond the year-long "odyssey" the group hopes that the findings from this trip will eventually inform the start of their own school in Brooklyn, New York. The founders also view this trip as a way to uncover the best solutions "on the ground" directly from teachers and students with a special focus on traditionally underserved and at-risk populations.  Harnessing ubiquitous technologies, the group plans to utilize multimedia ranging from podcasts to videos and interactive blog posts to report-back and provide free "professional development opportunities" for educators based on their "field" observations. One of the most striking aspects of this project is the insistence that, "educators can and should be at the center of educational reform," instead of the top-down approach we most often see at work in Washington and beyond.  Backed at least in part by a non-profit organization and donations from a crowd-funding campaign mounted online, the group which is headed by educator and former bond trader, Todd Sutler, will officially start their adventure on September 4th, 2012.
<p>
<b>Kickstarting their initiative </b>
<p>
Perhaps most interesting is not the findings that will come-out of this "odyssey," but instead the fact that the initiative was funded in large part, by "crowd-funding." Before even packing their cars, the initiative has broken new ground by nearly funding their entire project through Kickstarter.com. As of July 28th, 462 "citizen investors" used the online platform to help the group meet and exceed their goal of $75,000 (amount actually raised: $82,342). The Odyssey team is reaching far outside the usual funding channels (academic institutions, government agencies, foundations, etc.) to carry out qualitative research related to education. Regardless of the outcome, and whether or not a brick and mortar school is the product of this project, 462 people were willing to give money for a research project aimed at "bottom-up" education reform. Homer would be proud.
