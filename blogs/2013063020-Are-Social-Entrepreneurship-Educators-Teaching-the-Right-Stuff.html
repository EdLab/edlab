<p><b>Title:</b> Educating the Minds of Caring Hearts: Comparing the Views of Practitioners and Educators on the Importance of Social Entrepreneurship Competencies (2012) <p>
<b>Authors:</b> Toyah L. Miller, Curtis L. Wesley II, and Denise E. Williams 
<p>
<b> Source:</b> <a href=" http://amle.aom.org/content/11/3/349.full "> Academy of Management Learning & Education</a>
<p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> Demand for social entrepreneurship courses in higher education has shot up in recent years. Yet little if any research exists examining whether these courses teach relevant competencies. To address this research gap, the authors of <i>Educating the Minds of Caring Hearts</i> conducted a two-stage study. In the first part, they analyzed the survey responses of 150 social entrepreneurs and social venture capitalists on the relevance of 35 competencies deemed important in the literature on social entrepreneurship. They then ran a content analysis on 77 social entrepreneurial course syllabi from national and international universities. They compared these findings in order to determine the degree of alignment between proficiencies valued by practicing social entrepreneurs and competencies taught in college courses.  
 
<p>

<p><b>Findings:</b></p>
<p>
When survey participants were asked to rate the importance of 35 competencies, the options that received the highest scores were: the ability to problem-solve, build effective teams, management of financial capital, ability to lead others, and the ability to communicate with customer suppliers and other stakeholders. The lowest rated proficiencies were: management of administrative work, empathy or compassion, the ability to identify social problems, the ability to develop volunteer support, and valuing social impact more than financial goals. To test for consistency, respondents were also asked to rank the top-10 competencies out of a list of 35. The results were similar to the prior survey question. 

</p>
In terms of social entrepreneurial course content, the top five proficiencies listed across syllabi were: managing strategy development, managing financial capital, the capacity to measure outcomes, innovativeness and creativity, and identification, evaluation and exploitation of opportunities.
<p>
So how did competencies valued by social entrepreneurs compare to those being taught in formal courses? Both practitioners and course syllabi prioritized the ability to measure outcomes, solve problems, and manage financial capital. There were discrepancies, however, when it came to ranking the value of being able to market an organization, a sense of moral imperatives, and the ability to communicate with customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders.  While practitioners felt these competencies were very important, they were not so prevalent in course work.
  
<p><b>Moving Forward:</b></p>
<p> 

The findings of this study suggest that while there was substantial agreement between practitioners and educators, certain competencies warrant more attention in social entrepreneurial coursework. If the feedback from practitioners in this study is accurate in terms of picking out the most relevant social entrepreneurial competencies, then the results indicate that educators should focus more class time on fostering students’ ability to market, encouraging them to think about their moral ethos, and teaching them effective communication skills. But before jumping in and making changes to course syllabi, it is important to conduct further research on the accuracy of the practitioners’ assessment of critical competencies. Research that incorporates observations of social entrepreneurs "in the trenches" could offer invaluable insights into the necessary skills and knowledge and not just perceptions of the most important competencies. Such research can further inform educators designing social entrepreneurial coursework to prepare the next generation of social change makers.
