            It's a summary of my own paper :)

Engaging students with social learning technologies is a trend in modern e-learning. One of the biggest challenges is to provide student support in the context of social learning and at the same time allow students to feel in control. So, Open Student Modeling is one of the popular solutions to providing students easy-to-grasp and holistic view of their learning performance. However, most of the work in the literature focuses on individual representation of the student or communication/collaboration among the group in the social visualization approach. 

So, this work tries to extend the benefits of open student models from the cognitive to social aspects and focuses on using progress-based strategy to guide students to the most appropriate learning content.

The implementation for researching this goal, we use QuizJET (a parameterized self-assessment tool in Java programming language) with IntrospectiveViews (a scrutinizing semantically-enriched user interests model interfaces). IntrospectiveViews display users' interests in a set of keywords on a circular surface. We organize the course topics in the same circular fashion and use color shades to indicate the progress. The course topics are displayed in clockwise order in a pre-requisite sequence. (I invite you to read this paper for technical implementation in detail)

To evaluate this specific approach, we conducted a semester-long classroom study and compared across the systems without adaption and adaptive but not social OUM systems. To make sure they are comparable, we examine the assumption of homogeneity of variance, which was met. We found  the number of times that students attempt the self-assessment questions to be higher than non-adaptive one, but it's not higher than adaptive but not a social one. So, we looked at the data spread. We found that, in open social student model system, it decreased 25% of the standard deviation on the attempts. It's more conservative in terms of exploring the self-assessment quizzes. So, is it good or bad? To answer it, we investigated another parameter, successful rate, which measures the correctness of the answers when attempting the questions.  The result shows that, it's actually GOOD to have a combined knowledge-based and social-guidance based self-assessment system. It achieved the highest successful rate. (a significantly increase).
Sub-section summary:  Community wisdom DOES matter. 

In order to understand how the peer guidance work, we looked into detail of peer usage data. Students made 6.83 times of comparisons with other peers. But, did they just use it by curiosity or were they seeking the challenges or guidance? We found that students attempted on average four topics on the peer models and 4.67 questions. Moreover, there's a significant correlation on the more the students compared to their peers, the higher post-test scores they received. We also looked at the learning effect. Students achieved significantly higher post-test scores. (Reminder: it's a non-mandatory tool for the class, students could also learn from different other sources.) In our subjective evaluations, we administrated questionnaires to collect student opinions. We asked five dimensions: usefulness, easy of use, ease of learning, satisfaction, and privacy & sharing. 

Based on the feedback and results, we would like to improve the design and provide better support for students in five aspects: adaptive navigation support, personalized guidance, privacy management, visualizing multiple peers' models, and collaboration features.

Note: These five aspects were implemented and studied. Results are published partially in VL/HCC and under preparation for computer science educational journal publication.
