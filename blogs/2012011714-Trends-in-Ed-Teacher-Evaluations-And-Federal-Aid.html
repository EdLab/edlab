          <p>
            After speeches were delivered yesterday at Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. commemorations throughout the city, and reported in this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/17/nyregion/cuomo-and-bloomberg-on-attack-on-teacher-evaluations.html?nl=todaysheadlines&emc=tha29">this New York Time's article</a>, both Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg came-out fighting over teacher evaluations and the subsequent stalling of federal aid.  Namely that because new teacher evaluation guidelines have not been fully locked-down, and face fierce opposition from teacher unions and other special interest groups, federal education aid will potentially be delayed or denied to New York schools.  Both Cuomo and Bloomberg have expressed their disapproval at what they deem as an oppressive education bureaucracy that only serves to maintain the status quo for educators and not adequately address student needs.  To illustrate this point, Bloomberg stated on Monday <a href="http://www.nationalactionnetworklv.org/mission.htm">at the Harlem headquarters of the National Action Network</a>, “this school system shouldn't be run for the people that work in the school system.”  

As outlined in the NYTs article aforementioned, Cuomo will announce that school districts must implement more stringent teacher evaluation systems by 2013 or forfeit their portion of more than $700 Million federal education aid package the US government's <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop/eligibility.html">Race to the Top program</a>.  Currently, school districts at the local level evaluate teacher performance, but these reviews are viewed as inadequate and carry little to no consequence for tenured educators.  The proposed evaluations would be more specific and carry stronger consequences for educators who receive low scores.  Opponents of this new system, namely the president of the United Federation of Teachers, Michael Mulgrew, express concern that this issue has purely political motivations, “I believe he's (Bloomberg) trying to use this as sort of political grandstanding,” Regardless of the motivation many millions of dollars hang in the balance as all groups involved attempt to come to consensus.
