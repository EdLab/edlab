          <p>
            <em>Are you a Teachers College student, and, if so, what are you studying?</em>

No, I’m not but I’m a graduate of Sarah Lawrence College and I like to consider myself a student of life.

<em>Where’s your hometown?</em>

I’m a native New Yorker. Born in Queens and raised on Long Island. But I’ve also lived in Maine and Massachusetts.

<em>What did you want to be when you grew up?</em>

The first thing I ever wanted to be was a baker oddly enough. That never really went anywhere, though I do make a mean chocolate chip cookie to this day.

<em>What was your first job?</em>

I was a councilor at a summer theater camp in Skowhegan, Maine.

<em>What has been your worst job?</em>

There was a summer where I worked at a seafood restaurant in Maine. The people I worked with were all swell but the fact that I still smelled like haddock six months after working there…well that was a problem.

<em>What has been your best job?</em>

Best job? My first job. At the Rotch Architecture and Urban Planning Library at MIT. Such a great group of people and all those beautiful fine art books!

<em>What do you remember about your first day of school?</em>

Hehehe. I remember not wanting my mother to leave. I was a bit shy back then!

<em>Your favorite meal:</em>

Pretty much anything Mexican, especially if it is being served with a margarita in the company of good friends.

<em>Are you a morning or night person?</em>:

Night person all the way…which is going to make my opening shifts at Gottesman…well…interesting.

<em>A delicious dessert:</em>

I have to pick one?! A Fudgy Wudgy sundae. They serve them at this restaurant Moby Dick’s in Cape Cod, MA.

<em>Song you love no matter how many times you hear it</em>:

“Girls Just Wanna Have Fun” because it’s true. Girls (at least most of the girls I’m lucky enough to know) just want to have fun.

<em>A country you’d like to visit</em>:

I’d love to take a tour of the Greek isles. Or a riverboat cruise down the Nile.

<em>A book you strongly recommend</em>?

Howard’s End. It’s a classic.

<em>A sport you enjoy playing (or watching)</em>?

I’m not really a sports person but if the Steelers are playing I’ll go with my friend Kate down to her local Pittsburg bar and wave my towel-y.

<em>TOP THREE….</em>

<em>Best places to read?</em><em>
</em>Snuggled in bed
Under a tree in Central Park on a beautiful day
The cool quiet of my local public library on a hot day

<em>Complete the Sentence</em>

<em>The strangest thing I’ve ever done is</em>…. Slept on the streets of Amsterdam with the 9 other friends I was traveling with in college because we thought “Naw! We don’t have to make hotel reservations in advance!” Which actually you really should do…

<em>The most fascinating person I’ve ever met is</em>… Diane Wiest. She’s one of the world’s most talented actresses yes, but she’s also an amazing, kind and generous woman.
