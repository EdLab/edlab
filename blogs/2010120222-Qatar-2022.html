            FIFA just awarded the <a href="http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/russia2018/media/newsid=1344971/index.html">2022 World Cup to Qatar</a>, marking the first time soccer's showpiece event will be held in the Middle East. As I expected, there has been a large outcry from many who are questioning why FIFA is hosting a World Cup in a very volatile region. There are also concerns about the scorching Middle East heat, Qatar's lack of soccer pedigree, at domestic or international level, its size (close to that of Connecticut) and others claiming Qatar paid a lot of money to win the bid. FIFA, like any other international governing body, is very much a political institution and its rules, customs and makeup resembles that of a democratic government. I personally don't see where the outcry nor agree with the arguments from those expressing outrage at Qatar 2022.

FIFA made it clear nearly a decade ago that it will start hosting World Cups in under developed regions (mainly Asia and Africa). Of the previous 17 World Cups leading up to Korea/Japan 2002, seven were held on this side of the Atlantic, and the remaining ten in Western Europe. Clearly, a big part of the soccer community was not receiving its share of FIFA tournaments. Korea/Japan 2002 was the start of what FIFA hoped will be a change in focus and by awarding Qatar the tourney in 2022, it has reaffirmed its commitment to expanding the game to forgotten soccer lands. The 2018 World Cup was handed to Russia and that will be the first time the tournament will be held in Eastern Europe. 

FIFA deemed Qatar “high risk” prior to the vote and the naysayers are questioning why it will award the tourney to a country it has already marked as “high risk.”  The same was said of South Africa prior to this summer's World Cup but they hosted an excellent tournament and crime in the country, like everything else, came to a standstill during its month in the global spotlight. Qatar is highly qualified to host the tournament. It has the financial resources to build state of the art stadiums and all its stadiums will be air conditioned to quell concerns about the heat. It will build a national railroad system that will connect all the 12 host cities, all of which are an hour apart, making it a very small and intimate tournament. In a very volatile region, Qatar has remained very peaceful and its human rights record is the envy of most of its neighbors. They plan to demolish all the new stadiums they will build for the World Cup and use the debris to build 22 new stadiums in countries where there is a need for venues with the hope that those nations can also make a bid to host the World Cup. Qatar will host next year's regional Asian Cup and surely the cynics will be watching and sharply criticizing every mishap but for Qatar, it will serve as a perfect dress rehearsal for the main event in 2022. For once, FIFA's much-publicized motto “for the good of the game” actually rings true.
