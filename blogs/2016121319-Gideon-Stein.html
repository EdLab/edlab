<p>Gideon Stein is the Founder and CEO of <a href="http://lightsailed.com/">LightSail Education</a>, a an edtech platform dedicated to turning students everywhere into readers. Stein serves on the board of several nonprofit organizations including New Classrooms, Stand for Children, Narrative 4, Chalkbeat, Moriah Fund, and the unionized charter school University Prep Charter High School. Prior to LightSail, Stein co-founded and served as President of Future Is Now Schools, was the Vice Chairman of Success Academy Charter Schools, and was Founder, Chairman, and CEO of the enterprise messaging company Omnipod, Inc. (now a division of Symantec). Stein earned a B.A. from Wesleyan University.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and professional experience shape your work now at LightSail?</b><br>
<p>I became involved with education philanthropy in 2005 after the successful sale of a software company I founded. While building a couple of new buildings in Harlem, I became acutely aware of the quality of education in underserved communities and so I began serving on boards of schools, education reform organizations, and other nonprofits as a way to make a difference. From this vantage point, I learned what was working and saw the challenges, especially with low-income and disengaged students. My goal for LightSail was to take best edtech practices and use technology to deliver them cost-effectively at scale. Giving students access to great texts is only the first step. To get and keep kids engaged, books and texts have to be appropriate for students’ personal abilities with a library that adapts as they progress. Having nearly 20 years of experience as a technology entrepreneur enabled us to create real-time, embedded assessments and progress monitoring in texts in a natural way.</p>
 
<p>I’m proud to say that in only three years, LightSail’s adaptive digital platform is now used by hundreds of thousands of K–12 students across the United States and is now expanding globally. Our mission is simple: to foster a love of reading among children, which in turn will accelerate literacy around the world.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at LightSail will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>Success for me is seeing millions of kids around the world reading 30 minutes a day, whether it’s on LightSail or even physical books. Literacy is the basis for learning, and that’s why I started with reading. The science of literacy is simple. The more students read, the more they grow. From our data, and supported by independent research, reading at least 30 minutes a day appears to be the threshold for Lexile growth. Our data shows students who read 30 minutes or more a day on LightSail average gains three times what’s considered typical (4.9 L per week). That’s backed up by a recent study that Johns Hopkins University conducted with students reading on LightSail. Similar to physical exercise, readers can build stamina by practicing every day.</p>
 
<p>I would also want data to be an even greater resource for students, teachers, and school districts going forward. The beauty of having embedded, real-time assessment is twofold. First, students get immediate feedback on how they are progressing. Along with built-in rewards, this helps motivate them to increase the volume of their reading along with advancing the difficulty of the texts they choose. Second, teachers have immediate insight into student engagement and the opportunity to act more quickly to help struggling readers. For our school district partners, I would want them to have even more opportunity to identify and share best practices.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>Personalization and adaptive learning are tremendously promising in effectively educating a wide-range of learners in ways that foster their strengths while supporting and addressing their challenges. With a span of 3-4 years of ability in the average classroom, teachers must choose whom to educate every day, those who understand the material or those kids who need more support. What they usually end up doing, out of necessity, is teaching to the middle and in doing so they leave out the kids at the top and bottom of the class. If you have a platform that knows, every day, where you are as a learner and can tailor instruction precisely to you, you will be more engaged, appropriately challenged, and you will see significant gains more quickly.</p>
 
<p>Localization is another trend we’re seeing take hold. Countries, communities and schools are more and more focused on content that honors the student. In the case of literacy, it’s books and texts that reflect each child’s experience and identity. We’ve made sure to pay particular attention to this with LightSail and have curated a library of nearly 8,000 books that include a large number of diverse texts. Ensuring that book covers and content reflect a range of identities ensures that all children will be able to find books that celebrate their own identity and promise to engage them at greater levels. In addition, LightSail’s focus on Spanish content and our partnership with Antares Reading have gone a long way towards localizing content for our readers.</p>

<p><b>Apart from your role at LightSail, what are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>My work with education nonprofits keeps me pretty busy. I’m on the boards of half a dozen organizations that focus on improving educational equality and access for all children. While it’s certainly a lot of work to serve effectively while running a company, I find that my nonprofit works grounds me and helps inform the work I do with LightSail.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>Honestly, while I initially loved Twitter for news and information, I’m finding the platform less and less useful and have become increasingly turned off by the level of abuse inherent on the platform. I still check Twitter from time to time, but I now prefer to get my news and information directly from sources like the <i>Washington Post, New York Times, The Atlantic, The Wall Street Journal, EdSurge, Education Week</i> and even the <i>New York Post</i>.
