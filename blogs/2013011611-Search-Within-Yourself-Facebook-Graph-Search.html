          <p>
            While searching and printing newspaper headlines for this morning's Cafe News, a daily exhibit displayed in our library's cafe, I discovered the following news item across multiple papers (in multiple countries), though this particularly clever headline hails from London's <i>The Times</i>: “Search me: Facebook Prepares to Give Google a Poke.” Facebook announced yesterday its plans to unveil a search feature within its own compiled data. Akin, perhaps, to how Google Plus allows personalized searches on the internet, Facebook's search function will allow users to mine their controversially complied personal data to find things like: <i>What restaurant did my friend Dave recommend back in October?</i> or, <i>Where did that hilarious photo of the chihuahua wearing a tutu go? </i> Facebook also sees this as an alternative to Yelp, if you buy the idea that most people prefer their friends' restaurant recommendations over the general public's.

Google's personalized search, when it came out, was so upsetting to Eli Pariser of MoveOn.org, that he <a href="http://www.thefilterbubble.com/ted-talk">gave a TED talk urging social media software developers to please not go down this road.</a> He also wrote a book, <i>The Filter Bubble: What the Internet is Hiding From You</i>, which interrogates web personalization as a freedom of information issue. (We have this book here in our stacks at the TC library! Call number is: ZA 4237.P37 2001.) I signed up for Google Plus when it first came out, hoping to find an antidote to Facebook's tell all mentality, and promptly deleted my account when, still logged in, I performed a routine Google search and found it was giving me personalized results based on my current friendship with an ex-girlfriend. Her photo appeared at the top of my search bar, along with a handy compilation of our overlapping research interests (based on a robot's scrolling of my emails, I suppose) and I knew my time with Google Plus was over. The question nags: is personalization what most people want in a search option?

From a privacy perspective, one can only hope that Facebook's search will scroll through only data its users have intentionally and actively collected through their own accounts, and through connections with mutually agreed-upon “friends.” Aside from privacy concerns, it's arguable that this will become a welcome feature. The more each of us posts, the less accessible our own past posts become, and it's arguable that we should have easy access to past posts, past photos. If Facebook is a modern-day museum collection of our own social lives, shouldn't we be able to search them?

Recently, I was compiling my own writing for an entirely off the grid, intentionally non-digital print publication of mine: a zine. I thought it would be fun to include an assortments of anonymous quotes I'd overheard at the Park Slope Food Coop over the past six months. As a sort of hobby, I collect overheard (and completely anonymous) quotes, and usually I either text quotes to friends, or I post them on Twitter or Facebook. I scrolled my various social media accounts to find these anonymous quotes and discovered that because I post so many random statements in so many places, I couldn't actually find them. I wondered: why can't I simply search my own Facebook account quickly for past updates, or past photos? Why can't I search my text messages, for that matter? If the data is sitting there, stored on my phone, shouldn't it be searchable?

There isn't an easy answer to these questions. I think the discomfort with personalized searching comes with how it's being used by its users (or in this case, my friends), and what the companies storing the data do with it. Do we trust ourselves? Do we trust Facebook or Google?  If it can be done, should we do it?
