<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/english-idioms-learn-and-play/id1436747289?mt=8">English Idioms: Learn and Play</a> is an attempt to help advanced English language learners get a leg up in their journey to fluency. Definitions, examples, and sometimes the history of idioms are provided on the app for $2.99 a week or $9.99 a month after a three-day free trial.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The expansive library of idioms in this app is impressive and easy to navigate. All expressions are categorized alphabetically by topic (e.g., food, animals, sexuality) and represent a wide variety of idioms; some expressions feel more modern while others originated centuries ago. The ability to look through the dictionary of idioms is extremely helpful.</p>

<p>I also like that each daily practice session includes five new terms that are thematically organized. For example, one day you learn five sports idioms and the next you learn five health-related idioms. This seems helpful for memorization purposes and focus, and having just five idioms a day feels like a realistic and manageable goal.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The advertised gamification is perhaps the biggest let-down of this app. The games offered follow the same model each time; you are given a definition and you must put words from a word bank in order to form the corresponding idiomatic expression. This is not particularly fun or original, and what’s worse is that the games don’t reflect the idioms learned in your daily lessons. For example, after I learned my five sports idioms, the game I was tasked with completing tested my knowledge of expressions from the dreams category. The inability to test and practice what you have just learned makes this app terribly disappointing.</p>
 
<p>While I liked learning the history behind certain idioms, this information was provided only in rare instances. Several instances of incorrect definitions and other mistakes also left me pretty exasperated. For instance, the example provided to explain the idiom "chewing the cud" used the phrase "chewing the fat" instead, and the idiom "beats me" was listed as "what beats me." Finally, some examples didn’t situate the idiom in a realistic sentence but instead repeated the idiom’s history, such as in this example sentence: "In medieval times servants used to sit below the salt."</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>I was very disappointed with this app. Especially for a paid service, I expected a more reliable resource with well thought-out gamified learning opportunities as opposed to just a dictionary of terms. English Idioms: Learn and Play needs some serious work before I can recommend it.</p>
