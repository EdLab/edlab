            Creating tools to migrate websites stuff.

Web - human-centered

Technically: batch- processing, the cycles got shorter and shorter, we're still batch-processing, info in and out

Interacting, data come inside you

sinltiniiety

Four problems with data:
1. multiple dimensions
2. low grade
3. not play well other's, poor interoperability
4. can't own your own analytics

pdf -> phf, documents about proceeds

syntactical: computers talk to each other
semantically: receive 100% what is sent

interopability: misleading, something out there to be achieved?

example
150 years ago:
international commerce, happened randomly, clocked are not synchronized, our times are the right one, our solution is the correct one
-> same time, all around the world, that's what we try to push for

technical solution: a feed that synchronizes everything
Einstein calculates the difference in electronic signals sent two different places, how much time does electricity lags

visualize data simultaneously 
Microfiche - magnifying glass, give each one of us a microfiche, 

Car GPS processing frames, coffee bar terminal producing frames, a little movie about your own life
3D video environment, synchronize the movie of all people, 

Photo - cropping to head shot, 
-> when 4D (holographic), a picture map at the bottom of a cube, vertical time axis, grab a cit from the map and map it to a certain time point (this is like cropping the big tube to a smaller tube that covers the selected city and spans a small period around the selected time point)

visualization: build feedback with which people can figure out, snapshot all the elements of an event.
Bottom line: showing antecedence dependence

Inspiration: human, anthropology, politics
Electronic Frontier Foundation

New Wall Street growing around analytics

Solar panel: make money:
1. save electricity
2. state refund
3. federal grant
4. overproduce - pay back? renewable energy, become a small generating station, sell and buy between personals, smaller fees - a great model renewable data credits

Go to broker - subscription to your feed, buying from third party, fico information, your data should come from you like your garden, brokers says 30 companies request your data, small payments, control over which guys can get data

personal data is more valuable because it comes directly from you
portfolio of subscribers

feed generates: mirroring life, human contact rendered, I was there, start to get a sense how situation evolved and evolved

Image capturing intense wedding: cell, phones camera, all image data go to major social websites
4D feed: navigate along spatial and temporal axises

An example given, built using python, mongoDB, unity 3d online gaming engine
1) user pick a location from digital map
2) user sees a 3D space filled with small cubes, time axis extends inwards the screen, each cube's position associated with longitude and latitude, size associated with area
3) user navigates forward or backward in the screen to see cube maps at different time points
