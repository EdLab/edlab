          <p>
            One of the first things I learned in my 9th grade Social Studies class is that there is no such thing as a political line — it's a <a href=http://members.cox.net/jayc1832/The%20Political%20Circle.jpg>circle</a>. The further extreme you go in either direction, the closer you get to your ideological opposite. (Sounds familiar — like, the sullen teenager who vows to never become like his father but grows more like him each and passing day?)

Another thing I learned, this time through observation, is that not only are there two sides to an argument, but that there is always a minority segment. Some minorities do not have the sufficient representation they need and deserve and are hence ignored. Others are given complete control because the majority fears accusations of being “Un-PC”. Being accused of being Un-PC can mean anything; you are a sexist, racist, bigot, homophobe. And these days, being labeled “Un-PC” is a death sentence to your reputation and credibility (and not only just as a person, but as a corporation, a university, a business, a politician, etc). 

For this reason, the majority scrambles over its feet in order to try to be as politically “correct” as possible, and do all that it “possibly can” in order to give the minority a fighting chance at being heard. Needless to say, I'm all for equal representation, opportunities, and rights, (being a minority woman myself) but I can't help but wonder what happens when the once vulnerable minority becomes tyrannical and overbearing. 

<a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/23/us/23antioch.html>Antioch University</a> recently announced its decision to close its undergrad school until it can be reopened a few years down the road after some serious remodeling in both financial and academic structures. School trustees and officials have been meeting with alumni to try to explain their situation and their side of the story. Alumni are understandably unhappy with the situation and are going through various motions of trying to salvage their alma mater. 

For those whose parents did not live in the States during the 60s and 70s, Antioch University was at the nation's forefront when it came to hippies, free thinkers, revolutionaries, and world-changers. Its student population was renowned for its liberal mindedness and desire to change the world for the better; the next big thing since sliced bread. Naturally alumni would protest its closing; during its heyday (during the 70s when the world was just simply a better place according to some), Antioch University was a symbol of the nation's forward thinking youth. 

The article that I linked covered mostly the opinions of the alumni. However, there was a two sentence sound bite from AU's President Steven Lawry that was quickly buried and forgotten. While alumni were roaring that the closing AU would be disastrous, President Lawry contradicted them. 

Actually, he said (more or less) AU has become a breeding ground for political narrowness and a culture of resentment. 

Hold up — “narrowness” and “resentment” don't exactly sound like “hippies” and “liberal” to me. Am I missing something here?

Lawry said that in recent years AU has been attracting students that feel “marginalized” and that the social climate on campus has gotten to a point where students get called out for wearing Nikes. Case in point of the overruling minority? 

Okay, I get the whole logic of why Nikes should be opposed (child labor, international sweat shops, modern day colonialism, etc.) because it entails some serious issues that should be addressed. But my intuition tells me that efforts to change the world aren't really going to work if tactics consist of ganging up on some person because they dared to wear something as mainstream as Nikes, and shaming them. Because when people get all up in my face and are rude and harass me, I really want to join their cause. 

Maybe I'm not being fair, and maybe I'm not giving people enough credit, but I do believe that freedom of personal opinion, speech, and representation goes both ways. Yes, the underdogs need to have their say, yes, the majority can be oppressive and abusive, and yes, the system sucks. But when the minority starts turning to tactics such as the aforementioned lovely students of AU, they become no better than the system they were trying to break. In fact, they're worse; they as the minority, do not sufficiently represent the entire population they are a part of (I do believe that is what “majority” means) — so how can they efficiently cater to everyone's needs? 

The issue goes deeper than your <a href=http://www.omarskicks.com/images/nike-heineken-dunks-low-pro-sb-shoes.JPG>Nike Dunks</a>. In trying to be heard over all the clamor and din of “everyone else's” opinions (which, of course, don't matter), people are forgetting that forcing someone to listen can sometimes do more harm than good; it breeds further resentment and exacerbates people's willingness to ignore each other. It's a two way street and things aren't exactly going to be so smooth if you're trying to barrel through in a MAC truck.
