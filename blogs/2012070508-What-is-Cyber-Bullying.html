          <p>
            The recent case of Dharun Ravi, the Rutgers student accused and eventually acquitted of using a webcam to secretly record intimate moments between his roommate, Tyler Clementi, and his lover that ultimately led Clementi to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Tyler_Clementi">commit suicide</a>, has put a large scope on cyber bullying. As most states have or are scrambling to create laws regarding cyber bullying, the question I've been thinking about is what is cyber bullying and when can one identify it.

I am sure most of us have Facebook or some sort of online social networking account that we frequently use for various reasons. A large portion of activities on all social networking sites includes comments and pictures whether it is Twitter, or Facebook. Our comments are usually funny, witty, and a combination of the negative with some tease. Among young people, there is a tendency to always poke fun at our friends at every opportunity. Does this “fun” count as cyber bullying? Bullying as a concept is very hard to define in and outside of the classroom, as young people tend not to know how their actions and/or words can hurt others. I think the lines for bullying, especially on the web, is very blurry and lawmakers, as they have or prepare to tackle the issue need to take a closer look at how young people use the web and be specific in how they spell out instances of cyber bullying. This <a href="http://www.addept.org/site/parents_corner/teasing_bullying.htm#">site</a> sheds more light on teasing and bullying.

Can you think of instances when “cyber bullying” occurs and how educators, parents and administrators can identify such instances? Should we make identifying bullying one of the courses educators must take before receiving their teacher certifications?
