<p>As human augmentation becomes more common for everything from improving memory to vision, public discourse on the ethics surrounding the practice have grown. Deus Ex is leading this conversation with their newly released ethical design framework for human augmentation.<p>
 
<p>How much can humans be altered before they are no longer considered human? Can robots who feel pain, learn, and respond emotionally be considered human? What if everyone around you adopts a special augmentation, but you donâ€™t want it, do you have the right to say no? Deus Ex is working with academics, entrepreneurs, and developers to answer these questions. To begin the conservation, they have laid out a seven-point framework for designing augmented humans. The framework considers human autonomy, social creative-destruction, education for the public, and ethical research principles, with the hope that their research can thwart abuse and division.</p>
 
<p>These conversations shift the obligation and responsibility of creation onto the creators, calling for them to be moral agents in their development. What are your thoughts on the educational possibilities or discussions that can occur? Join the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/32168/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>
 
<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>
 
<p><b>@00:55 Victoria57251:</b> We recently attended a seminar on the topic of UpCreation. The notion that you can create something new without destroying what was before. This ethical framework discussion seems to carry out these ideals, particularly the second and third points regarding educating the public and minimizing social disruption. It is important as we move into an area of technological advancement that we have never seen before that we make ever effort to be conscious about the changes around us.</p>
 
<p><b>@01:19 saraehardman:</b> I think this topic is a breeding ground for deep philosophical discourse. Should we be striving for "human augmentation"? Sure, we already use machines in our daily lives, but how will it change humanity when machines are inextricably attached to us?</p>
