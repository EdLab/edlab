<p><b>Title:</b> Purposes for Literacy in Children’s Use of the Online Virtual World <i>Club Penguin</i> (2014)</p>
<p><b>Author:</b> Jackie Marsh</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1467-9817">Journal of Research in Reading</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> How do children engage in literacy practices in a virtual world? </p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> This qualitative study was designed to investigate students’ literacy practices in a multi-player online gaming environment called <a href="http://www.clubpenguin.com">Club Penguin</a>. It was conducted in an inner-city elementary school located in England. The data collection portion of the study included distributing online surveys to 175 students to explore their knowledge and experiences in virtual worlds, recruiting 26 children for semi-structured interviews to understand their regular virtual gaming over the course of two academic years, and conducting case studies of three children who were filmed playing in Club Penguin in their homes.</p>

<p>The author first coded the data deductively, by categorizing children’s literacy events based on a set of apriori codes found available in the literature. The codes consisted of five purposes of literacy including establishing and maintaining relationships, accessing or displaying information, pleasure and/or self-expression, skills development, and identity construction and performances.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The author found that an additional purpose of literacy emerged from data analysis -- "literacy for establishing and maintaining social networks." In the study, Club Penguin provided a motivating context for students to construct their online identities through various social networking behaviors (e.g., sending postcards to other avatars, making inquiries on an in-world newspaper, visiting other igloos to learn how to better decorate their own, etc.). Through concrete examples, the author delineated that the purposes for literacy in virtual worlds are consistent with the purposes for literacy in the offline world. Thus, rather than viewing children’s virtual experiences as autonomous and separate from their offline activities, the author argued for the importance of tracing both continuities and observing differences between children’s online and offline worlds for teaching and learning in a digital landscape.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> The digital landscape of contemporary childhood suggests that learning and experimentation in virtual worlds will become a common experience. It will be worthwhile to study the affordances of virtual worlds as well as children’s playful literacy practices within them. This research will better inform the nature of transformative teaching pedagogies in a digital age, remixing the old and new learning practices, and addressing children’s multiple ways of meaning making and identity construction in both online and offline spaces.</p>
