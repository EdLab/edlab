<p><i>"Move This World helps students and educators in classrooms across the country understand, express, and manage their emotions healthily in order to create safe and supportive environments where effective teaching and learning can occur."</i> (<a href="http://movethisworld.com/team">Move This World</a>) </p>

<p><b>Building Social-Emotional Well Being</b></p>

<p><a href="http://movethisworld.com">Move This World</a> has a mission to teach students social emotional skills they can use both in the classroom and in other aspects of their daily lives. To do this, the organization creates short social-emotional learning videos geared toward students from preschool to high school that teachers can easily implement at the beginning and end of each school day. Teachers can incorporate these videos into their classrooms without prior training; they simply have to press play.</p>

<p>Founded by Sara Potler LaHayne, Move This World has gone through many transformations since its birth in 2007. The videos currently on its platform were developed in collaboration with the Curry School of Education at the University of Virginia and the American Institute for Research in order to ensure that they are appropriate and effective for students and teachers.</p>

<p><b>Easy-to-Implement Video Lessons</b></p>

<p>The videos focus on the five social-emotional learning core competencies as defined by the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and decision-making. While the videos all feature the same group of college-aged or high school students, the content varies based on the intended age group. For instance, pre-schoolers practice social awareness by passing dance moves to each other, middle schoolers practice relationship skills by complimenting each other, and high schoolers practice self-awareness by thinking of a mission statement.</p>

<p>While there are new videos to start and end each day, the lessons are scaffolded so that students can build their social-emotional skills over the course of the year. The videos also include a short guided discussion section that prompts students to think through a particular question and share their responses with others.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Move This World hopes to make students of all ages more aware of their own emotions and those of others in order to build better relationships, decrease stress, and improve general well being. It’s tough growing up, and it’s tough being a student, but teaching kids specific vocabulary and skills gives them access to better social interactions and greater emotional well being.</p>
