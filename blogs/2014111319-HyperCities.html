<p><i>"HyperCities aims to become the first media platform for supporting the revolution of Web 3.0, the birth of the geo-temporal human web"</i> (from <a href="http://hypercities.com/about/">HyperCities</a> site)</p>

<p><a href="http://hypercities.com/">HyperCities</a> is a dynamic educational project at the intersection of cartography and information visualization, humanities and technology, geography and digital space. The project has produced grounded cultural narratives in 27 international cities. HyperCities uses Google Maps and Google Earth (among other technologies, like GPS-enabled cameras and cell phones) to allow users to explore historical layers of city spaces.  Accessing the cities and exploring them is straightforward. Once a city has been selected, users can select the time period or the area of the city they are looking to explore on the map. Within each frame, users can access everything from scholarly content to community-generated content. Users can also click on historic sites to learn more about them and overlay older maps of the same cities. </p>

<p><b>Digital Humanities</b><br>
Developed by UCLA and the University of Southern California, HyperCities seeks to place stories in time and space using digital technology. The result of the project is a complex digital layering of global histories that others can explore. Current HyperCities include Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Rome, Lima, Ollantaytambo, Berlin, Tel Aviv, Tehran, Saigon, Tokyo, and Shanghai. Each city is made up of a "Digital Topography" layer that includes oral histories, events, and community stories overlayed on current and historical urban cartographies. HyperCities, sponsored by the McArthur Foundation, is based on the idea that as our lives become increasingly digital we have to find ways to make online spaces more human.</p>

<p><b>Educational Space</b><br>
HyperCities uses archival material to create links between different knowledge communities, and it also boosts read-write culture by enabling users to view, but also create media (including oral histories, maps, and photographs). High school students and college students can act as cultural archeologists of the many people who live and have lived in urban spaces. HyperCities, moreover, is built from the ground up by the people living in the cities. In this way, HyperCities constitutes a participatory learning environment that is already being used by thousands of teachers and students. The site also links to outside resources including the founders' book <i>HyperCities: Thick Mapping in the Digital Humanities</i> which was recently published by Harvard University Press.</p>
