            Crowe, Edward (2011). <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/03/pdf/teacher_preparation.pdf">Race to the Top Teacher Preparation</a>. Center for American Progress.

One of the main focuses of the Race to the Top fund was improving teacher preparation. As such, one of the dimensions states were evaluated by were their ability<blockquote>to adopt more vigorous accountability mechanisms and to establish or expand preparation programs “that are successful at producing effective teachers.”</blockquote>

Part of this stipulation "[requires] states to measure and disclose program effectiveness results to the public". Student achievement was the agreed-upon program outcome.

Whereas prior to RTTT there existed "little real accountability and limited public disclosure about weak or strong programs", the 11 winning states who have implemented some measure of publicly reporting teacher effectiveness represent  a radical change in the way teacher quality is addressed in this country. 

5 states have taken a step further than just reporting this data: they've agreed to hold teacher training programs accountable as well, giving those institutions an incentive to consistently perform at a high level.

I think, regardless of your opinion of RTTT, this is a positive shift in education for teachers and students alike. It will be interesting to see the results of the winning states when the data is made public (I believe that's in 2014). There is a lot of talk about the power unions have in protecting bad teachers, and I believe having public data will diminish the grip they've maintained for too long.

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>
We talk a lot about teacher quality at EdLab and have seen some presentations during seminars on improving teacher effectiveness. But does making data public effectively 'shame' educators? I don't believe teachers will be named individually, but is this necessary bullying, or is it a strong armed response to a decades old problem?
