<p><a href="https://getjoezoo.com/">JoeZoo Express</a> is a Google Chrome extension that syncs with Google Docs, allowing teachers to provide tailored feedback to students on their writing assignments. As more teachers use Google Docs in the classroom, this simple extension gives them the opportunity to provide quick and effective feedback. In a busy classroom, when isn’t a tool like this welcomed with open arms and loads of teacher appreciation? </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Teachers can connect JoeZoo to Google Classroom, from which they can add students to the extension, situated on the right side of the Google Docs page as a sidebar. From there, you can manage assignments and create rubrics through easy-to-follow instruction prompts provided by JoeZoo. The rubric system is especially helpful, as it allows you to toggle between different types of grading scales, both qualitative and quantitative, and select and write evaluation criteria directly into the program.</p>

<p>JoeZoo’s feedback system is fairly straightforward and easy to follow. You can highlight the text on Google Docs, then select from a menu of different categories of feedback, such as formatting, grammar, mechanics, punctuation, and structure. Within each category, there are various options such as "Comma Missing" or "Redundant Phrase." The menu of options provides teachers with a quick and easy means for providing detailed feedback without having to type and retype it multiple times within an assignment and between students. Another bonus feature is JoeZoo’s constructive support within certain feedback options. For example, if you select "Adverb Missing," the comment comes with the tip: "Remember that adverbs are words that modify a verb, adjective, or another adverb, providing added detail to the reader." You can also edit the text of the comment and tip if necessary.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although JoeZoo offers a vast array of different feedback choices, the multiple categories and selections can be a little overwhelming, and it could take some getting used to before being able to quickly navigate through the options in order to find the appropriate one. For teachers who much prefer to write comments right away instead of trawling through drop-down menus in search of the exact comment they need, JoeZoo might not be the best tool.</p>

<p>One way that JoeZoo could also improve its available features is by providing a system that tracks whether or not students actually use the feedback provided by the teacher. Even though feedback is important, it falls flat if students do not carefully review each comment and make the appropriate adjustments. Perhaps a checklist-style system that students can go through when reviewing their corrections can provide teachers with a snapshot view of whether or not students are reflecting on the feedback in their writing process.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Nowadays, writing assignments are frequently conducted through Google Docs, and JoeZoo provides teachers with a tool that significantly cuts down on grading and editing time. The extension’s simplicity is its biggest strength, as it integrates seamlessly into Google Docs without requiring teachers to download or employ external software. The program’s prioritization of rubric creation and management also shows a conscious and thoughtful consideration of how teachers must track and monitor student progress through rubric-based assessments.</p>
