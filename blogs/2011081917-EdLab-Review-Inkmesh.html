<a href="http://inkmesh.com/">Inkmesh</a>, a site developed around comparison shopping for e-books, has been getting mentioned a lot in the wake of the price fixing class action suit against Apple and five other publishers. The site works well, but its functionality is defeated in light of said price fixing. 

<b>Pros:</b>
Inkmesh was built around a simple goal, to create a database of e-book pricing and format so users could find the best deal on an e-book that would work on their device. The site accomplishes this goal pretty solidly and also provides subject browsing and lots of search refinements without many distractions. These features put it miles ahead of similar sites <a href="http://leatherbound.me/">Leatherbound</a> and <a href="http://luzme.com/">Luzme</a>. The site also provides a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/inkmesh">Twitter</a> feed of free promotional e-books from big booksellers. 

<b>Cons:</b>
The interface is relatively bell and whistle-less. The site is clean and utilitarian, but it isn't pretty. It's the website equivalent to James Franco: <a href="http://gawker.com/5061358/james-franco-is-perfect-gushes-robot">super symmetrical</a>, but a bit off-looking in practice. There is a strange non-ad/ad sidebar that routes to amazon purchase links for e-readers instead of linking to e-books in compatible formats as I expected. 

For much searching and theorizing, I still couldn't quite tell from whence their subject information came. Some of it seemed to be pulled from authority headings, but clearly not all as there's lots of repetition. A lot of them also seem quite wrong (<i>Sense and Sensibility</i> in Health?) but copious search refinements dull the blow. It comes out to be rather homely, but functional in a pinch and perhaps subscribes to the idea that a sense of accomplishment from the hunt will revive the boringly easy modern book search. 

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> 
The best laid plans...Inkmesh could be really useful, if there were price differences to be had in e-books.
