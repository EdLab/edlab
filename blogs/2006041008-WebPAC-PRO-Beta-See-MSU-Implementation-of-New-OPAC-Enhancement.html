          <p>
            Michigan State University is the first INNOPAC site to implement a new OPAC interface called WebPAC PRO: http://www.lib.msu.edu/ WebPAC PRO is a FREE enhancement that will be available in Release 2006 of the INNOPAC software, due for general release in late August. Release 2006 will include other free enhancements as well as a roster of new extra-cost features so we may want to postpone our OPAC redesgn until Fall. One of the new extra-cost products will allow patrons to write reviews of resources in the OPAC. Press Release: December 5, 2005 Innovative to Launch WebPAC Pro Updated from November 30, 2005 Next-Generation Suite of OPAC Technologies Emeryville, CA&mdash;Innovative Interfaces announced today that it will launch a new online public access platform called WebPAC Pro that drives a powerful set of Web-based tools for libraries that want to take advantage of newly available technologies and implement the latest Innovative developments. WebPAC Pro offers improved information retrieval using RightResult&trade; search technology and enhanced display functionality including more opportunities for customization of content and features. This new software foundation responds to what libraries are demanding for academic campus integration and enhanced patron services in all types of libraries. WebPAC Pro will be offered as an option to all Millennium customers free of charge as part of the 2006 Millennium Release. &quot;WebPAC Pro will support libraries as they strive for a pivotal role as information providers on the World Wide Web,&quot; says Innovative VP of Product Management Betsy Graham. &quot;We're now giving our customers another option that brings home all of the advanced online catalog products and features we're developing.&quot; WebPAC Pro Highlights Today, some libraries want to enhance their online presence in ways that go beyond the traditional OPAC and the &quot;library portal&quot; model to better integrate the latest Web functionality. With WebPAC Pro, libraries will be able to take advantage of the latest Web technologies and engage Web-savvy users more effectively than ever before. WebPAC Pro will be the foundation for a number of new technologies, optional products, and enhancements to libraries that bring the OPAC to the next level: RightResult&trade; Search Technology - Innovative is proud to introduce RightResult search as a part of the WebPAC Pro platform. RightResult search technology returns a grouped result set based on an advanced relevance-ranking algorithm developed by Innovative. The result is that the patron is most likely to find the title in question immediately and at the top of the results display. Over the past several development cycles, Innovative's development and product teams have been working on this new search functionality. In testing, it has demonstrated significant improvements in catalog search results. Campus Integration - Web OPAC Pro is the foundation for campus integration optional products that the company announced earlier this year including Single Sign-on, External Patron Verification (LDAP), and Courseware Integration for Blackboard&reg;. Advanced RSS Tools - While Innovative&rsquo;s current OPAC offering allows libraries to place incoming RSS feeds into the public catalog, WebPAC Pro sets the stage for advanced RSS tools that make the library a publisher and increase patron convenience. Feed Builder is a new product that allows libraries to send Real Simple Syndication (RSS) data based on any Boolean query of the Millennium database. This means that libraries can publish their newest holdings so they can be accessed like a typical &quot;blog&quot; or news source through a feed reader. In addition, WebPAC Pro offers My Record Feeds, which will deliver patron-related information through RSS, such as holds placed or available items, in real time. WebPAC Pro is a new software foundation that will be the basis for all major online catalog product development. It also establishes a foundation for future industry-standard implementations (including Web serving). And, in its tradition of offering a seamless migration path for its libraries, Innovative will offer WebPAC Pro as an option for existing customers that can be easily turned on and configured. The company will also continue to support its classic Web OPAC. In this way, libraries will be able to choose the complement of technologies they want to utilize online easily and without disruption.
