          <p>
            One of the biggest mistakes in early education is to not fully understand some part of a specific topic you've learned. For instance, a kindergarten student should be able to fully grasp the basic concept of counting numbers before making him or her understand it thoroughly. The reason is because the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/science/fewer-topics-covered-more-rigorously.html?ref=education&_r=0">Common Core Standards</a>, which has been introduced and adopted by many states, including New York State, tends to reduce the amount of topics in a specific subject a teacher will cover with their class during a school term. My concern is the impact this will bring to our children's education. 

<blockquote>If the new mathematics standards adopted by New York and 44 other states work as intended, then children, especially in the lower elementary grades, will learn less math this year.</blockquote>

Nonetheless, I think the common core will improve students' learning and the way they study. However, I am also worried that the new standards might be overwhelming for some students. If you take a look at the new mathematics standards for kindergarten students, they are now supposed to orally learn how to count from 1-100 and write all of the numbers to 20. Previously, the kindergarten students were expected to orally count 1 to 20 and write 1 to 10. You can see that there has been a great amount of change, and although this change will help the students learn a lot, I also think that it puts them in a difficult position in terms of quickly understanding what they have learned.
