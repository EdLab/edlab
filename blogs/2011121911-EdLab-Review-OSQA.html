<a href="http://www.osqa.net/">OSQA</a> is the open-source Q&A platform that the professors who taught <a href=''https://www.ai-class.com/home/">Stanford's AI class</a> used to develop their proprietary, self-moderated Q&A platform, <a h ref="http://www.aiqus.com/">Aiqus</a>, for their ground-breaking online course.  

<b>Pros:</b>
OSQA allows you to develop a truly open Q&A platform with stand-out features including wiki-like social editing, proprietary/internal messaging and full social media integration, a "reputation system" that assigns "karma" points for helpful questions & answers, voting, the ability to create groups and the option to "federate" content from other sites you own.  Overall, some of the biggest "pluses" of this platform are that it is simple & intuitive to use, well integrated and the feature-set seems practical, with many real-world applications from discussion to CMS.  As a bonus, OSQA was developed in Python and supported by Django.

<b>Cons:</b>
Their is a proliferation of Q&A platforms from <a href="http://askbot.com/">Askbot</a> and <a href="http://disqus.com/welcome/">Disqus</a> to <a href="http://www.quora.com/">Quora</a>... I am not totally convinced that OSQA is necessarily far superior to all the rest, however, I am impressed with the simplicity of their UI and the available features.  

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> 
As we consider development of an open-source discussion board and Q&A to integrate within existent tools like Ednode, ResearchBroker & Pundit, it is important to test and track the success of existent platforms.  It was a real testament to the simplicity and practicality of OSQA's feature-set that it was successfully used by the ground-breaking Stanford online AI course and their 100,000+ virtual students.  A central question for us to ask is how relevant is a discussion board when you have truly advanced Q&A platforms.  Does  this make discussion boards obsolete and irrelevant?  

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> 
Simplicity and openness seem to rule a successful Q&A site.  Openness as in infinitely customizable and able to be openly edited and modified by the community of users.  If it works for Stanford and scores of virtual students it is worth exploring further...
