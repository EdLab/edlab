<p>It’s no secret that the traditional method of education is losing its luster for people who want their kids to be prepared for a life in the current technological age. A lone teacher standing at the front of a room lecturing to a class full of students is not only boring, it is not even an environment that fosters collaboration or critical thinking. How can we redesign classroom practices to more successfully equip students with the skills and knowledge required to thrive in the future? </p>

<a href="https://www.altschool.com/">AltSchool</a> may be one of the solutions to this educational dilemma. This two-year-old school groups students in an unexpected way. The classroom is a mixture of kids of various ages, and contains students at different academic levels. Since each child is given personalized lesson plans based on their own individual learning needs, the typical factors that inform class demographics become archaic. Rather than being lectured to at the same pace as other students of the same age, each student is given a list of their requirements for the week and assessed on their completion of these tasks. Sounds like a great way to enrich student maturity, time management, and individual responsibility.</p>

<p>In addition to having some freedom over their own work patterns, students at AltSchool are also permitted to listen to music as they work independently. Instead of commanding their focus on a single activity, students’ ability to multitask is embraced and encouraged. Learning in this environment cultivates the skills that children will need in a world that is intertwined with technology. A person’s attention is now typically focused on multiple tasks at a time, a practice familiar to students at AltSchool.</p>

<p>This new approach to schooling seems like it may be appropriate for the current age of technology. Would you send your child to AltSchool? Let us know <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/23141/">on Vialogues</a>.<p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<b>@00:00 Beckieb:</b> I wonder who gets admitted to Alt School. I know in San Francisco, there is a lottery that administration uses to decide which students get to go to certain schools.</p>

<p><b>@00:49 rrubenstein:</b> I wonder what that model- the mix of ages and grade levels-is like for the kids, with or without the use of technology.</p>

<p><b>@01:04 jacob.albert4:</b> Haven't kids always been the education beta testers?</p>
