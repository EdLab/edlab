            The fluctuation of contract based cellphone deals have led to a creation of many other small cellphone companies that do not require contracts. Sensing the growing threat to their market by these small companies, large cellphone companies such as T-Mobile have recently teamed up with Metro PCS, one of the nation's largest non for contract cellphone companies. 

Companies such as Metro PCS make it easy for people to afford cellphones, but companies such as <a href="http://techland.time.com/2012/12/14/the-105-iphone-5-smaller-carriers-turn-to-payment-plans-to-bring-down-smartphone-prices/">Cricket</a> are introducing payment plans to bring down the high costs of owning a phone, especially smartphones.
According to the article, Cricket offers customers a deal in which they pay an initial fee of $105 to leave with an iPhone 5, which is steal considering all other major carriers charge as much $700 without a contract. Cricket's plan includes a month of service and a loan from Progressive Finance to finance the rest of the deal. Their monthly charges are around $55 and includes unlimited voice and messaging with a 2.5 GB data plan.

Though there are drawbacks to the deal Cricket is offering, it may be the new trend in mobile offerings, as cellphones increasingly become an essential part of life. Even the aforementioned T-Mobile has plans to make their cellphone offerings more affordable and give customers more time to pay it off.
