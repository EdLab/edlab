<b>Plus (The Good)</b>- Salesforce.com, the enterprise cloud computing company, recently released a beta version  of their new secure enterprise collaboration application and social development platform.  Their new tool, Salesforce Chatter (http://www.salesforce.com/chatter/), leverages popular social networking models to facilitate intra-company collaboration in real-time with a secure, private social network. Content, applications and employees share information via  profiles, status updates, feeds and customizable groups, enabling feedback, commenting, trouble-shooting, while at the same time fostering deep connections. 

From a technical standpoint, the Salesforce Chatter social platform contains a new set of APIs that enable developers to push data from any app into Chatter feeds. Any of the 135,000 native apps built on the Force.com platform can now be social, streaming updates to Salesforce Chatter's feed. Developers can build integrations to pull data from any app, including on-premise software apps. In addition, Chatter has development toolkits for Google, Facebook and Twitter. Chatter is also portable, it will be available on any BlackBerry, Windows Mobile device or iPhone. 
 
<b>Minus (The Bad)</b> - The Chatter tool is limited in the media types and formats that can be uploaded to the system. Business content, like pdf documents, spreadsheets and presentations, can be uploaded to a user's profile, but other multi-media formats are not currently available. In addition, Chatter users can filter the most relevant Twitter feeds into their Chatter app, however monitoring this outbound source of information could be time-consuming for the company. Also, for security reasons this application can only be used within the company, which limits the community and content that can be accessed and shared by this application.
 
<b>Equals to (The Bottom Line)</b> - Salesforce Chatter (http://www.salesforce.com/chatter/), is like Facebook, mySpace and Twitter combined, on steroids. It is a great tool for larger companies to connect with otherwise disparate corporate teams and departments to share information and industry/competitor knowledge in a familiar social networking model. The secure, private social network environment allows for the dissemination of sensitive company materials, however the incentive to use this tool (such as performance reviews and feedback tied to team/group/company goals) seems lacking. 

<b>Recommended use</b> - This tool is clearly positioned for the corporate world, however as a model of a secure enterprise collaboration application and social development platform, it contains many "best practice" examples as far as filtering, cross-application feeds, push/pull data models, and intra-company community building.
