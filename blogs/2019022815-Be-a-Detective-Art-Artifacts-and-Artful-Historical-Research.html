If you are curious about the history of art education, anatomy of artifacts, and nature of historical research, then this guide will serve to illuminate. Think of yourself as a detective, with an insatiable desire for knowledge and a keen eye for observation. You follow clues to solve the mystery of an object, text, or image -- how and why it comes to be, what it tells us about teaching and learning, perhaps even when it begins to shape theory and practice in the field. As teachers in training, you might examine a <a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/viewfile/119969">letter</a> from Pearl Greenberg to Angiola Churchill; <a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/gallery_singleimage?pid=1&amp;number=199&amp;order=date&amp;pagenum=1">photograph </a>of art students modeling a Greek cross; or <a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/viewfile/27184">film</a> that shows how New Lincoln Schoolers grow through art. Can you write a biography of an historical artifact, such as a <a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/viewfile/18266">Victor D'Amico Art Barge Blueprint</a>, or a<a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/viewfile/18225"> box of lantern slides</a>? With creative skill and taste in hunting down clues, comes logical reasoning in piecing information together and telling a good story. Here is one fine <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/30803">example</a> (an episode of <em>Seen in NY, </em>with a <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/25754/">shorter version</a>, too<em>).</em>

For another interesting angle, you might read, <em><a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/viewfile/19465">The Object: Lost and Found</a></em>, in which Victor D'Amico describes how learning to "find" art involves curiosity in seeing; courage to look for the unexpected and the unfamiliar; sensitive choice; and conviction, using proof or evidence, to make the judgment that the found object, place or thing has aesthetic value. These same principles can be considered in the process of historical research which bears appreciation of primary sources as valuable educational tools. To light your way, we highlight key institutional publications that inform the development of art education, while drawing attention to digital repositories, archival catalogs, local art archives, and other helpful resources. Also included is a listing of sample artifacts to spark your quest.

This blog post complements Dr. Ami Kantawala's presentation, <em><a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/viewfile/149541">Primary Document Analysis: Biography of a Historical Text</a></em> for the class, Historical Foundations of Art Education (A&amp;HA4085).

There are several ways to locate primary resources that may be of interest to you. These include searching online catalogs, national or institutional archival databases, or inquiring directly at individual institutions.

Any institution could potentially have an archive, from a small theater to governmental agencies or corporations. If you have an interest in a particular institution, you should contact that institution directly to inquire if they have an archive and whether you may access it.

Here is a very small selection of some of New York City's largest institutions with physical archives:

If you are curious to see where else in the world collections on an individual or group may be held, you can search <a title="Worldcat" href="http://www.worldcat.org/">WorldCat </a>(short for "world catalog"). To do this, use the advanced search, select "archival material" as the format, and search by keyword. Once you locate a collection of interest, you can inquire at the individual institution to get access.

<em>Using a Finding Aid</em>

Finding aids are the documents created by archivists to describe and give context to collections and help users identify what parts of the collection are of interest to them. They usually consist of the following sections, which may vary in title:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Title and years of coverage:</strong> The title is usually the name of the person who collected the documents. While the collection will be most closely related to this person, it may hold contents of interest on other individuals. Be sure the years match those you are interested in.</li>
	<li><strong>Overview:</strong> provides the size of the collection (usually in linear feet or number of boxes), its creator, and a brief abstract.</li>
	<li><strong>Administrative information:</strong> details guidelines for citation and any access restrictions.</li>
	<li><strong>Historical or biographical note: </strong>summarizes the life of an individual or the history of an institution and can serve as a starting point for further biographical research.</li>
	<li><strong>Scope and content note: </strong>describes the content of the collection including topics, types of materials, and years covered.</li>
	<li><strong>Arrangement:</strong> lists the hierarchical order of the collection as it has been arranged in the archive.</li>
	<li><strong>Box and folder list: </strong>details the box and/or folder numbers of the collection and their contents.</li>
</ul>
Knowing these essential parts of a finding aid can help you decide if a collection is relevant and which boxes or folders to request when onsite. It is important to note that access policies vary by institution and by collection, so you should make sure you are able to access a collection before visiting the institution.

	<li>Scrolls, 2 Chinese (circa 1948) <em>Scroll 1</em>. There are 11 characters. Two characters are a group. The last group contains three characters. The 1st group means harmonic. The 2nd group means a kind of color paint. The 3rd group means a good smell. The 4th group means two fruits (peach and plum which in Chinese culture symbolizes a large number). The last group means abundantly, overflowing. Translation: a) First 4 groups involve TC students. b) The last group means TC will maintain its historical status in education and wishes TC will continue to educate lots of students. (In plain translation, it also means “overflowing”.) c) The left tiny characters signify Chinese year 37 June (which in AD is June of 1948). d) The lower left contains  the name of the person who wrote the scroll. <em>Scroll 2</em>. a) There are 11 characters. Four characters are a group. The last group contains three characters. The first group in plain translation is "think about where the water comes from when you drink it". In Chinese this means, never forget that everything we have right now comes from the efforts of people long ago. It also describes "thankful". b) The other two groups (or phrases) are not recognizable. c) On the right side the tiny words denote “a gift from the Columbia University Teachers College Chinese Student Association."d) The left part in plain translation means "mother, school, for memory". “The gift is given as a memory to TC. Another hint of "mother" means TC is just like mother who gives "birth" and "educates" each student. - See <a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/viewfile/9752"><em>Introducing</em> <em>English Poetry to Chinese College Students</em></a>, by Hsiao-chuan Liu</li>
