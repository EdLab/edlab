<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept that frequently gets thrown around in conversations about the high-tech future developed countries envision for themselves, but countries outside of the global north are often not included in such visions. The IoT, or the network of devices with the ability to connect to the internet, from iPhones to coffee makers, represents a trend that has the power to transform both how we live and how we learn, and a group of researchers recently made the point that less-developed regions also deserve access to such technology. With assistance from the Ministry of Science and Technology of Thailand, researchers designed an Internet of Educational Things (IoET) device and tested its effectiveness in northern Thai elementary schools to improve both active learning engagement and outcomes.</p>
 
<p>Over the course of three years, researchers designed, gathered feedback, and tested their IoET prototype with 244 third-grade students and eight teachers at four rural primary schools outside Chiang Rai, Thailand serving low-income farming families or underserved ethnic minorities with limited access to public services. The IoET device was created to resemble a toy octopus, with tentacles that could collect information from the environment (such as humidity, temperature, and brightness). A mobile app was also created to allow students to store, access, and interact with the information collected.</p> 

<p>The classes studied were divided into two groups: one which used the IoET for science-based learning activities while the other did not. To test the effectiveness of the IoET, all students took a pre-test in which they were asked to draw a concept map demonstrating their knowledge of mushrooms. After participating in three learning activities about fungi, either with the IoET or without, students took a post-test in which they completed a questionnaire about learning engagement and again drew a mushroom knowledge concept map.</p>
 
<p>Through comparing pre- and post-test concept maps and questionnaire responses, the researchers found that students using the IoET device showed significantly higher learning outcomes and had better learning engagement. Additionally, students using the IoET device showed greater improvement in their concept map scores and reported higher interest and enjoyment in the learning activities, along with lower anxiety.</p>

<p>The researchers believe that the success of the IoET was in its ability to provide rich, hands-on learning experiences for students while making it easier to record information and observe environmental changes. This study demonstrates the potential of IoET technologies in underserved areas, and indicates that new technology can hold promise in a variety of contexts.</p>
