<a href="http://www.newclassrooms.org/">New Classrooms</a> is an organization dedicated to re-imaging traditional schooling. It addresses the overcrowding problem many teachers face by implementing a radical solution: If there are too many students for one classroom alone, get rid of the classroom-- or, at least, your perception of one. Since students learn at different paces, and it is nearly impossible for one teacher to personalize her lessons so as to reach every student in the class, current instructional approaches inevitably leave much to be desired. New Classrooms collaborates with schools to come up with spatial configurations that address the learning needs of all students. <p>

One such configuration involves combining the forces of multiple teachers in the school to create a mega classroom with a number of instructional stations to support different learning styles. In this way, students can easily find an approach that best meets their academic needs while teachers can impart multiple skills simultaneously. Small groups, large groups, digital tutoring stations... Joel Rose (co-founder and CEO) feels that when you aren’t closed in by walls, the possibilities open up. <p>

Says Rose, "Sadly, we’ve been talking about the future of education in this country for the last 20 years, but it’s been relegated to white papers and conferences." <p>

Could this serve as the new model for in-school education, or does it simply confound an already complicated issue? <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/9652"target="_blank">Leave your thoughts</a> in the ongoing discussion on Vialogues.

<b>@00:52  JudyM:</b> I personally work well in and love open spaces too. I'm just wondering how well students with attention disorders would cope and I think there must be a lot of ground work done on self-determinism and inner motivation prior to actual working in open spaces. Another question - why start in 7th grade? Start in 4th grade and have the students grow "into" this autonomous-geared open learning centers area. <p>

<b>@01:02 dsyny: </b> I love the idea of students being able to move around stations. It seems to me that it would break up the monotony of the class period and give students the ability to experiment with different styles of instruction in an innovative way. Open seating plans are being utilized more in more in the business world to encourage creativity and collaboration so it makes sense that this style would begin in the classroom.
