<p>As fish go, Zebrafish are both robust and complex, which is why EPFL's Robotic Systems Laboratory chose them to study social interactions between individual fish. Researchers developed a closed-loop system in which a robotic Zebrafish was not only able to influence the fish's behavior, but also adapt its own behavior by learning how to communicate and move like they do. As the robot spent more time with the fish, its swimming mechanism improved, and when tested in different aquariums, the robot was able to mimic the fish's behavior, prompting them to change direction or swim from one room to another.</p>

<p>Similar studies have been carried out on cockroaches where, to integrate into an insect community, a robot just had to emit pheromones. But fish are more complicated, and integrating a robot into a community of vertebrates involves many more criteria, including imitating the fish's physical characteristics, like shape, color, stripes, etc., and mimicking behavioral characteristics such as linear velocity, acceleration speed, distance between individual fish, the size of the schools, their vibrations and motion, and the rhythm at which they move their tails. </p>

<p>Do you think we should be using technology to influence animal behavior? What else could we learn from these experiments? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/41470">on Vialogues</a>. </p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:34 Dyranda:</b> Didn't Jane Goodall, Dian Fossey, BirutÄ— Galdikas, David Attenborough et al., already get up close and personal with animal life? What is the point of all this? What else can a school of Zebrafish tell us that we don't already know? What really gets me is the human bots at the end of this clip... why do we need them?</p>

<p><b>@1:32 Ryan Allen:</b> It seems like this technology is already being used in research (and entertainment). </i> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaIH5tLmC8U">BBC</a> did a series where they integrated robots mimics into various animal groups.</p>
