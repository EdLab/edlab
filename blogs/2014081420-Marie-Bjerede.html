Marie Bjerede consults, writes, and speaks about how to create environments for learning and working enabled by technology platforms and self-organizing cultures. As a nationally recognized authority on mobile learning, Bjerede is the founder of <a href="http://e-mergents.com/" target = "blank">e-Mergents</a>, a learning technology consultant group that serves learning communities, organizations and life-long learners. She has over 25 years experience leading high-tech and wireless communication development. She works with schools to use personal, mobile devices to support students in accelerating and taking ownership of their learning. Bjerede currently advises schools, startups, and technology leaders on the products, practices, and platforms that enable and scale authentic learning and teaching with technology. She holds a Bachelors Degree in Physics from UC San Diego with a minor in Philosophy.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b>
As many people do, during most of my education, I experienced the odd cognitive dissonance of being a successful (good grades) student while recognizing that my learning was weirdly superficial.  I knew I could pass tests on material I didn’t understand and (on occasion) fail tests on material where I was solidly grounded.  I developed a sort of learned helplessness, often finding it difficult to correlate hard work or even understanding with success. And yet, I was successful by any normal measure.
<p>
When I joined the workforce I found work simple in comparison to schooling, as all that mattered were results.  Long hours, yes, but those hours correlated directly to quality outcomes and real success (as opposed to the "fake" scholastic success of passing tests via rote memorization of vaguely understood procedures.)  A few years later, when I went back to school to study communications theory to better understand software-based signal processing I finally discovered "real"  (non-fake) learning.  Finally there was a context to apply what I was learning - my day job writing software for communications systems microprocessors.  A few more years after that, when I had spent enough years in management I similarly discovered "fake" work—in the form of endless, circular meetings that took the place of real work.
<p>
These alternating experiences of real and fake in both formal and informal learning and work have formed the basis for my work as a leader, a technologist, and an edtech advisor and advocate.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b>
Two sets of professional experiences were transformative for me.  The first involved developing a work environment and culture of self-organizing teams with breakthrough productivity and engagement and requiring little to no management. This work environment was based on principles later popularized by Daniel Pink in his book, Drive, and nurtured a virtuous cycle of increased autonomy, increased mastery, and shared purpose.  As an executive hiring high-tech employees into this workforce I was struck by how often new employees, particularly those just out of school, were unprepared to act as independent agents, instead waiting to be told what to do, even micro-managed, and then believing they had to find the one "correct answer" to their assignments without "cheating" by collaborating with their colleagues.
<p>
The second involved continual, self-directed learning both at the personal and organizational levels in order to stay ahead of continually rising expectations and the commoditization of last year’s expertise. As the world wide web became part of our professional environment, learning shifted from simple training to a participative exploration with a professional network that spanned nodes internal and external to the organization.  Instead of merely taking classes on how to deal with complexity or attending a seminar on disruption which were isolated events never applied to daily work, I followed discussions in the news and the blogosphere, conducted conversations with thought leaders, applied leading-edge thinking in the context of my day-to-day work in concert with my colleagues, then contributed back to the field what we learned as an organization and as individuals.  With emerging fields and practices, this unprecedented learning environment brought me from novice to contributing expert in 2-4 years in areas such as Innovation, Web 2.0 business models and implications, and wireless education technology.
<p>
These professional experiences gave me the opportunity to enjoy real work and real learning and to question which elements of schooling (and traditional work) provided that same level of authenticity versus those that reduced human agency and support for self-directed, participative learning and contribution.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br>

<b>Answer:</b>
I hope to lend my weight to the shift from impersonal, cookie-cutter, decontextualized, "fake" learning towards personalized, authentic, deep, "real" learning.  I hope to help shift power from impersonal institutions to individual teachers and families.  I believe that technology infrastructure and standardization at the right levels will create a platform for explosive innovation at the level of personalized experiences for learners and teachers.  I believe that cultural shifts that value student agency and competence will improve engagement, enjoyment, and outcomes for learners and educators alike.  So I work with a diverse array of stakeholders, from industry to researchers to educators to policy makers to technologists on removing the barriers to personalization and innovation by leveraging technology.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> 
There are any number of trends that are driving or experimenting with making learning real—whether they succeed will depend on how they evolve. The common core standards advocate for deeper, cross-disciplinary, relevant learning. The maker movement engages students in learning technology, manufacturing, engineering, and other modern skills as a side effect of pursuing their personal interests.  MOOC’s are exploring peer-based learning at a massive (and sometimes less massive) scale.  Data systems and digital learning resources are evolving to give students real-time feedback on their learning and progress so that they can learn at their own pace, following their own path.  Most importantly, a national infrastructure is slowly being put in place that enables students to have 24/7/365 access to the Internet.  With that foundation in place, the opportunity arises for education to become a platform that serves students and families according to their needs and preferences - and as the salient characteristic of a platform is that’s its users can employ it in unexpected ways never intended by the architects, this infrastructure will create the conditions for innovation on Internet time that has thus far been denied the field of education.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b>
Of all the projects currently on my plate, by far the most interesting are the two I have the honor to work on with the <a href="http://www.cosn.org/" target = "blank">Consortium for School Networking (CoSN)</a>.  As project director for the <a href="http://www.cosn.org/mobilelead" target = "blank">Leadership for Mobile Learning (LML)</a> and <a href="http://www.cosn.org/focus-areas/it-management/send-smart-education-networks-design" target = "blank">Smart Education Networks by Design (SEND)</a> initiatives, I work with leading districts across the nation as well as industry leaders in identifying the next practices of transformational learning where every student has a personal connected device, as well as the technology and business model trends that are going to drive the network infrastructure that will support and catalyze that transformation.
