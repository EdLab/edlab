            This excerpt from a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/showbiz/2008/12/17/cook.straight.no.chaser.cnn">CNN interview with Academy Award winning actor Ben Affleck</a>, who has been spending a great deal of time in <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3075537.stm">DR Congo</a> helping with the humanitarian crisis currently unfolding there. His new documentary with Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7788633.stm">Gimme Shelter</a>, highlights the crisis and the urgent need for an international response to a crisis that has left millions dead and thousands more as refugees in one of the worst humanitarian crisis in history. Affleck's decision to align himself with the crisis in DR Congo follows that of George Clooney, who has been actively campaigning of behalf of victims in Darfur. One of the HBO movies I've been working extensively on, <a href="http://www.sandandsorrow.org/">Sand and Sorrow</a>, is executive produced and narrated by Clooney. Sand takes viewers to the heart of Darfur where refugees, victims, aid workers, and military personnel offer varying insights into a complicated and deadly conflict that is nearing its fifth year. Pulitzer Prize winner and NY Times columnist Nicholas Kristof featured prominently in Sand, has been <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E1DA1030F934A15750C0A9629C8B63&scp=1&sq=Will%20We%20Say%20'Never%20Again'%20Yet%20Again?&st=cse">offering personal and vivid accounts of his time in Darfur</a>and the lack of international action there.  

Judging from the interview, Gimme Shelter will have the same objective as Sand, in that it asks the international community and world leaders to act. In both crises, tough talk by global leaders has been backed by little or no action at all. It is also worth noting that in Sand, then US Senator Barack Obama is featured urging action along with former Republican candidate, Senator Sam Brownback. It will be interesting to see how <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEd583-fA8M">President-elect Obama</a> deals with two of the biggest humanitarian crises currently facing the world when he assumes office in a month's time. A copy of Sand is available for anyone interested.
