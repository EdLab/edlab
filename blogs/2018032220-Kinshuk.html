<p>Kinshuk is a teacher, innovator, and Dean of the University of North Texas, where he is researching ways to provide personalized learning experiences to students in real-world situations. Kinshuk, who goes by a single name, believes technologies such as virtual and augmented reality have the potential to extend authentic learning scenarios to include hard-to-recreate situations and on-the-job training scenarios that benefit teacher and student.</p>

<p><b>You have long been committed to advancing research into individualized and adaptive online and distance learning systems in global environments. Has technology been friend or foe in this endeavor?</b><br>
<p>Technology has certainly been a friend; it has opened many doors. Technology does not direct or guide; learning takes the driver’s seat. However, it allows for those affordances that were either difficult to achieve or simply impossible. For example, advancements in sensor technologies have enabled the analysis of students’ personal attributes, their surroundings, and their situations in real time, to ensure effective instruction in authentic settings. In individualized and adaptive online and distance learning systems in global environments, technological developments are particularly important. Students come from a range of backgrounds; they have different competencies, preferences and capacities and their learning varies across environments. Therefore, understanding their needs in real time is critical for effective learning. Technologies available today not only allow teachers to understand their students better but also enable intervention exactly when and where the student needs help.</p> 

<p><b>How has your educational trajectory and professional experience shaped where you are now, professionally?</b><br>
<p>My first degree was in mechanical engineering, followed by a master’s in mechanical computer-aided engineering. Both of these qualifications provided me a very practical aptitude, which I find invaluable in my research and in every other aspect of my profession. During my doctorate I was very fortunate to work with an extraordinary expert, Mr. Ashok Patel, who had a vision for revolutionizing the way students learn concepts. My first exposure to personalized learning was primarily due to the discussions I enjoyed with Mr. Patel. Over the years I have worked with international experts, teams of outstanding researchers, and highly capable students to explore aspects of adaptivity and personalization; from mainstream web-based adaptive learning systems to mobile technologies, and ubiquitous learning environments. My work has evolved toward a holistic ecosystem of transforming learning systems to smart learning systems. It has been a fantastic journey that continues to amaze me.</p>

<p><b>You have said in the past that technology does not govern or guarantee learning; it provides affordances. How do you see tools like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) doing this?</b><br>
<p>It is certainly true that technology helps the learning process and provides affordances. Virtual reality technologies allow learners to experience situations that would otherwise be very difficult to undergo during learning. For example, exploring anatomy or understanding the workings of an engine, or how the human heart works; it is almost impossible to see a working human heart since, once opened the heart is no longer working in a real situation. Similarly, augmented reality techniques allow for the creation of learning situations in real time by annotating instructions, guidance, and other information on the visuals of real objects. Augmented reality also allows for augmenting models and other visual information on real artifacts, enabling learners to understand complex concepts easily. Research in AR and VR is advancing very fast, and I am hoping that our mainstream education embraces these advancements at similar fast pace.</p>
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>Adaptivity and personalization of learning are certainly the future. Recent advances in learning analytics approaches and techniques have provided additional tools that take adaptivity and personalization to the next level. It is now becoming possible to understand the growth (or decline) in individual competencies and other characteristics of learners over time, and as they progress from childhood to adulthood and enter into the workforce. It’s also possible to benefit from the patterns that emerge from such analytics, and identify how the learning process can be made more effective for large groups of students and in different contexts.</p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on? Is there a big project in the pipeline?</b><br>
<p>My research has always benefited from partnerships, and that continues. With experts from various parts of the world, I am looking at improving learning and training scenarios by using analytics in AR and VR-based learning situations. Our focus is on the knowledge and skills that are required in process environments, such as oil and gas industries, workflow-based problems, and so on.</p>

<p><b>Who do you follow religiously on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>While I use social media for knowledge gain and for dissemination of information, I much prefer other forms of knowledge, such as journal articles and blogs. I follow widely, instead of following a few people religiously.</p>
