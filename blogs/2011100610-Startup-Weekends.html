<a href ="http://startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekends</a> is an interesting event that takes place in many cities across the world. This event is catered towards anyone interested in finding other people to partner with or start a business or a product. About half of the people who attend these events are in the technical field with the other half in the business field. These two groups of people come together to startup an online or mobile business or product. The motto of the event is “no talk, all action,” which sounds like serious business to me. This three day event is dedicated to providing budding entrepreneurs with other like minded people so that they can work together to develop a product or business. People meet and form teams where they can begin working on their product or business, and these teams can still meet up after the startup weekend to continue establishing their business.

To attend this three day event, you would have to register online and pay a fee, but this fee goes toward the food provided over the weekend. People will need to bring a laptop, business cards, a camera and videos of the event as well as their ideas for a new product or business! The weekend will start off with ice breaking activities, and 60 second pitches for each attendee's new startup. After pitches are finished, all attendees will vote on their favorites and using these votes the top ideas will be selected to be worked on over the weekend. Towards the end of the weekend, participants will finish up with their products and present their work to judges who will then pick the teams with the best business/product and hand out prizes.

New York City also has these startup weekends and the next one will be on November 18th-20th. If you go to their <a href ="http://nyc.startupweekend.org/">website</a>, you can find out more information on where the startup meets are and how to register for them. I think this is a great way to startup a business or product. The event provides entrepreneurs a chance to network with other like minded entrepreneurs, and it is in a fun environment where people can get really creative. Even though people attend the events eager to start something up, there is an added incentive in the event to try to come up with the best idea so they can win prizes! Some of these prizes are Incorporation Package from Cooley, Amazon Web Services Code for $200, 6 Months Shopify Credit & Chat with Shopify Execs, 1 hour consulting time with DFJ Gotham, and Free Account at Silicon Valley Bank. As you can see these are not usual prizes you would win from game shows, but I think these prizes are way more valuable to individuals seeking to startup their own businesses.
