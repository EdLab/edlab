At UMass Amherst, active learning is a key pedagogical concept. Several newly built classrooms on the campus boast amenities that support team-based learning (TBL). The rooms are equipped with circular tables that seat a maximum of 9 students and have up to 3 such tables per room. Each table has an enough power outlets for all team members and its own large monitor to aid in group work and class share-outs.  Surrounding the class are all-you-can-draw whiteboards. <p>

Students like their new classroom setup because it allows them to have more hands-on experience with the material. Professors like it because they are able to interact with small groups of students, as opposed to 30 individual students. <p>

The university plans to roll out several more TBL-friendly classrooms. Given the attributes already included, are there any changes <i>you</i> would make to subsequent rooms? Smaller tables? Different seating? Is all that tech really necessary? <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/12042">Add your thoughts</a> to the ongoing discussion on Vialogues. <p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@02:09 Clark:</b> Most of the TBL classrooms I have heard about are within science classes. Is there a reason for that? Why isn't there a group-focused learning atmosphere in humanities classes? <p>

<b>@00:48 Rita:</b> I wonder how they came to make the decisions for the additions in the room. Did they ask students what they wanted? Teachers? Was it based off of research? I really want to know how they came up with 3 groups of 9 as the magic number. I'd imagine smaller groups would be more effective...
