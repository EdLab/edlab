<p><a href="http://crowdmark.com/">Crowdmark</a> is an online grading platform for educators in K-12 and higher education. The application is a web-based tool that enables users to collaboratively grade papers and exams, assess classroom performance with data visualizations and trends, and speed turnaround on graded items. Crowdmark automatically calculates and exports scores and educators can instantly email results and feedback to students. Though similar to other grading applications like <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1878">Gradeable</a>, Crowdmark targets a more ‘’serious’’ crowd with its subdued design and sophisticated interface.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Like most grading platforms, Crowdmark’s best attribute is its ability to reduce grading time for educators. Teachers can scan and upload a student’s exam to the application to begin digitally grading and commenting directly on the test. Additionally, Crowdmark automatically anonymizes each exam, ensuring unbiased grading. The interface also has the ability to grade exams automatically based on QR-code technology. Educators simply create their exams using one of Crowdmark’s templates (with a unique QR code at the bottom), enter the answers, print out the tests and distribute them to their class. Teachers then rescan the completed exams and the QR code identifies the exam and automatically grades the questions according to the teacher’s answer key. The platform even gives users the option of dividing the workload among multiple graders for faster turnaround.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>This application is useful for educators with access to high speed feed scanners. Flatbed, sensitive, or low-resolution scanners will make the process of scanning exams a labor-intensive operation (and that’s before the grading process). It is essential for users to have a certain level of comfort with technology, though there may still be an adjustment period or learning curve for those accustomed to grading in the traditional format.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Crowdmark is a great tool for those looking to expedite their grading process but are still attached, by personal or institutional preference, to paper testing. It’s an especially useful application for educators with large classrooms or lengthy exams, as it enables users to mark and assess tests quickly in an organized fashion. Although its usability depends on a crucial, external component, Crowdmark’s benefits are sure to outweigh the investment in a high-speed scanner for those not yet ready to invest in fully digital testing.</p>
