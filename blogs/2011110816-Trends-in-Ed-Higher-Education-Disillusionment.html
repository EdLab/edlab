            It seems like more and more are feeling disillusioned by the returns to higher education. Jared Bernstein, well-known left-wing economist at the Economic Policy Institute, <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/On-the-Economy/2011/1108/More-education-isn-t-always-the-solution">guest blogged</a> on this subject at the Christian Science Monitor today. A week ago, <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/11/kauffman_econ_b.html">a poll of econ-bloggers</a> conducted by the Kauffman Foundation found that a large proportion suspected that higher education was largely signaling, rather than human capital formation. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/briancaulfield/2011/10/26/peter-thiel-zaps-cleantech-higher-education-launches-early-stage-research-effort/">Peter Thiel's efforts</a> have continued to be highlighted as well. <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/164348/audacity-occupy-wall-street">The Nation ran a piece</a> on MFA graduates not being able to find work and now joining the Occupy Wall Street. This is no longer a fringe view of higher ed; this is a trend.
The question now is what should be done. There's the elitist route; start shutting the doors to higher ed, even if it means the lower and middle class get hit hardes. Them there's the reform route, which is much harder to achieve and overly idealistic. The elitist route is too easy and dangerous for my liking. Higher education has undergone an age of decadence and has, in my opinion, declined in quality. The standards for admission and graduation are lower for most non-selective schools. On the other hand, we've done an equally poor job of educating the talented. Selective schools live off of their brand to cherry-pick and signal.
What this means for ed-tech is yet to be seen. Where there is disruption, there is opportunity. Yet for online higher ed...I smell the end. Online higher ed feeds off the bottom of the totem pole...and the bottom is always the first to fall out.
