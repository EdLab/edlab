Mandarin is one of the most spoken languages in the world and it’s one of the most popular to learn. But with an exponentially growing number of students and only so many Mandarin language teachers, what’s a learner to do? <p>

A new software program, developed by publishing giant Pearson in conjunction with Peking University, is introducing students to the first automated oral Chinese exam. The software is able to grade students on their spoken Mandarin; there is no human assessor involved in the process. For $30, students are able to receive feedback on their grammar, vocabulary, fluency, pronunciation, and even tone <i>immediately</i> after taking the test. What’s more, the exam can distinguish between different dialects and accents with its voice recognition software. <p>

For people who need to prove proficiency in a language, like students trying to skip a year of beginner lessons, the quick-graded alternative to in-person exams could be a sought after solution. How do you feel about computer-graded exams? Add your thoughts to the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/17655">on Vialogues.</a><p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@01:01 BridgetJane:</b> What would happen if, hypothetically, you took a Mandarin course taught by a computer and then had your final exam graded by computer but you didn't realize that the software was buggy so that, for the entire time, you were learning the completely wrong intonations?? Could that be possible?<p>

<b>@01:56 Clark:</b> What if you have a speech impediment? Does the software take that into account? This is where the unbiased nature of machines might work against an otherwise hardworking student.
