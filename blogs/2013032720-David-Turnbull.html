David Turnbull is leading an affordable, in-house design revolution, one university at a time.  Turnbull is responsible for the design and development of the majority of the University of New South Wales’ online and mobile innovations.  From a better conference-hosting hub to a <a href="http://cwu.unsw.edu.au/upcoming-projects/central-projects/">unique faculty and student profile management tool </a>, Turnbull and his team build it all in-house and for much less than outside contractors.  The value proposition is clear: design and development can and should happen on the home court.

<b> EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW </b>
<p>
<b>Question:</b>How did your educational trajectory affect your current work?<br>
 
<b>Answer:</b> I think the primary advantage I had moving into higher education was that I delivered projects across UNSW prior to joining. This meant that I had the chance to understand many of the issues involved in digital delivery within the university space and knew what many of the opportunities and issues were. 

My years of experience within digital agencies also enabled me to modify the agency model to build an effective digital delivery unit that fits the particular processes and project requirements within higher education. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I think having roles where I was free to develop processes that met both the internal stakeholder and consumer requirements has been a huge benefit. Even in small digital agencies I have seen complete breakdowns between client management and production that had resulted in everything from small dramas to complete disasters. Having an overall awareness of process means that end-to-end systems can be created and effectively evolved to meet the needs of both simple and complex project development and delivery.  
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br>   

<b>Answer:</b> I hope that the units and project owners we work with gain a larger understanding of the complex relationships that exist between their units and every other unit in the University.  I also hope that they stop seeing the web as a big complicated expensive problem, and see it as a fun, effective and efficient means to make their workflows easier.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> Obviously the continued use and evolution of mobile devices will be key for recruitment, and the engagement with learning systems at the university level. We as educational web professionals need to determine how best to develop engagement strategies and deliver projects that will meet the universal and specific needs of all of our respective cohorts across a number of mobile devices and use cases.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Aside from the specific projects, we are generally working on syndication of content, or turning static content into data. We would like to take any content from any site we build and be in a position to repurpose it and push it to any other site. Specifically, we are doing this with UNSW staff profiles. Through a project to create authoritative profiles, we can have staff fulfilling multiple public roles (faculty, school, research centre, researcher, etc.) syndicate a single adapted version of their profile to multiple consuming sites from a single "profile Engine," eliminating the need to maintain multiple profiles on separate sites. This will eliminate the need to administrate profile content in the future as should the individual leave the university, their authenticated profile data will be removed automatically. Profiles for new staff will also be created automatically.
