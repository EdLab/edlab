Aaron Schmidt is a worldwide recognized specialist in library technology and usability. He has been a circulation clerk, reference librarian, and library director.  Aaron has published articles in School Library Journal, Library High Tech News, Online, and currently writes the LJ column, The User Experience.  He has presented on the topic of library technology and usability worldwide. In 2005, Schmidt was named a Library Journal "Mover & Shaker." 

He advises organizations working with libraries nationally and internationally such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Global Libraries Program. Currently he is the Digital Initiatives Librarian for the District of Columbia Public Library but still lives in Portland.  He helps plan forward thinking; fun projects for the library, helping them connect to the community and teach them about the Read/Write Web.  He also assists with website visioning, conducts usability testing, leads the library's Library 2.0 Interest Group and helps coordinate and generate ideas for the library's digital research and development project called DC Library Labs. He was part of the team that created the first iPhone and Blackberry online catalog searching applications. Aaron maintains a library and website usability weblog, walkingpaper.org and can be reached at librarian [at] gmail [dot] com

Design is more than choosing pretty colors. Design is all about solving problems and even if you don't know it, you're a designer. In this presentation Schmidt will convince you to take a more active role as information service designer. After this presentation you'll have a keener critical eye and a framework though which you can make your library a place that people want to use.  He'll discuss website best practices, and how design research can create a truly user centered library.
