<p><b>The Anti-MBA</b></p> 

<p><a href="http://www.etsy.org/pilot_program/">The Regenerative Entrepreneur Program</a> is an educational pilot program designed by <a href="http://www.etsy.org/">Etsy.org</a>. The pilot program is participatory and aims to provide a free business education to entrepreneurs who can then directly affect and influence their communities. Etsy.org wants provide a business education to those who cannot afford a traditional MBA, or can’t pursue one because of other obligations like families and work. The Regenerative Entrepreneur Program aims to teach skills like daily reflection, systems thinking, and brass tacks business know-how through lectures, workshops, and one-on-one mentorships. </p> 

<p>Each participant is a co-designer of the program and expected to provide a learning experience or a lesson during the pilot. The work completed in the pilot program is not meant to be abstract or theoretical, but rather practical and immediately applicable for new or existing small businesses. The course is documented online, and will be accessible later for the participants, as well as others interested in the program. The pilot program will go through different iterations in different locations. Etsy.org does not intend to run a massive open course for this program, out of concern that that kind of platform could easily stifle creativity and mute the practical, hands-on aspects of this type of business education. Rather, the virtual aspect of the program is designed to go beyond a top-down, one-way learning stream. </p>

<p><b>The Details</b></p> 

<p>The Regenerative Entrepreneur Program is made of 15 to 20 participants who meet on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons until January 2016. Etsy.org estimates that participants should schedule ten hours per week for the program for both in-person and remote learning. In addition to transportation to the activities and lessons, Etsy.org is providing a physical workspace at locations throughout NYC for the participants that can be used any time at the participants’ discretion. Etsy.org’s as-yet untested pilot program is an exciting entry into new kinds of learning experiences; if post-program assessment measures are ever released, it could even chart the way forward for what learning might look like in an increasingly connected sharing economy. </p>
