            <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1790476/peter-thiels-latest-project-funding-for-diy-garage-scientists?partner=gnews">Peter Thiel is at it again.</a> The university is still his enemy but this time he's targeting scientists, not students. Thiel is trying to pick off scientists for a handsome sum of money provided they actively seek to publish, patent, and commercialize their research. For him, much of scientific research is entrepreneurial and there is untapped potential in the form of raw scientific research ripe for the picking. The push is in nanotech and biotech primarily and Thiel is actively searching to fund 'platform technologies' in testing and instrumentation that spark rapid innovation in these fields. 
This, like his idea for getting students to become entrepreneurs, strike me as a positive but hardly promising development. While entrepreneurs are awesome, I think his idealization is likely to make this latest effort less fruitful than he would hope.  I think it's great that he's trying to bring more innovation to market and in the process make science a more profitable endeavor, but I worry that his plans are not sustainable. Research and development, by its very nature, entails high fixed costs and often low marginal costs. This makes it very easy for one person to put in all of the hard research and the other to swoop in and steal the idea for nothing but produce at the same marginal cost. For this reason, we have typically separated R&D from commercial enterprise. Nevertheless, I wouldn't be surprised, given Thiel's abilities, if he is able to sustain this model and I certainly hope he succeeds given the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-Stagnation-Low-Hanging-Eventually-ebook/dp/B004H0M8QS">technological stagnation we are currently witnessing</a>
