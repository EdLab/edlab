Robert Pronovost faced a challenge a lot of teachers can relate to. Among the many students in his second grade class, some were high performers, some low, and some, of course, fell somewhere in the middle. He wondered how he could effectively teach all the children in his class at one time, given their differing learning levels. The answer came to him in the form of technology; more specifically, in games. <p>

Mr. Pronovost recognized the relationship between play and learning and decided that a little experimentation was in order. But, he faced yet another challenge: he lacked the technological resources to carry out his plan. Not one to be bested by such an impasse, Mr. Pronovost took it upon himself to acquire what he needed through numerous avenues. His moxie paid off when he was awarded new Apple computers, iPods, and an education grant from Facebook. <p>

Among the technologies procured from his various grants were two games, one of which helps students attain mastery of math skills while the other provides adaptive, individualized learning experiences for each student. During the times when most of his students are learning via digital resources, Mr. Pronovost finds himself able to work more closely with those needing more in-person support. He, and his students, couldn’t be happier with the results of his experiment. <p>

Have you ever faced a challenge similar to Mr. Pronovost’s? If so, how did you respond? Tell us your story on <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/7202">Vialogues. </a><p>
 
<b>@1:44 Clark: </b>This is a really lucky classroom to have a 1:1 ration of students-to-computers.<p>

<b>@1:47 DLales:</b> It's great that the students are getting instant feedback from these learning apps. But will the instant feedback be good enough to help students learn?
