            The assassination of <a href=“http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm”>Benazir Bhutto</a>
last month threw a wrench in Pakistan's already fragile struggle for democracy. Bhutto was seen by many, myself included, as the counter to the authoritarian rule of Pervez Musharaf, the military strongman who seized power in a bloodless coup nearly a decade ago. Bhutto served as prime minister of <a href=“http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan”>Pakistan</a> on two occasions (the first female to serve as head of state in an Islamic country). Though corruption charges led to her dismissal on both occasions, she remained a very popular figure in the country and her role in Pakistani politics, as well as that of Musharaf, took a drastic turn on 9/11. When the U.S. started its offensive against Taliban and al-Qaeda forces in neighboring Afghanistan, Musharaf pledged his undying support to the U.S. as many Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters fled the border to the mountain regions of Waziristan, a lawless tribal area in Northwestern Pakistan whose inhabitants are sympathetic to the al-Qaeda and Taliban cause. Since Musharaf became one of the few leaders in the Islamic world to support the U.S. in its war on terror, the U.S. and its allies cast a blind eye to the fact that Musharaf was a dictator who showed no signs of easing his grip on power. In essence, Musharaf was allowed to rule Pakistan the way he pleased so long as he continued his support for the war on terror. Then Musharaf's fortunes and that of the war on terror changed around 2006 when reports started surfacing that al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters had regrouped in Waziristan and had become stronger than pre-9/11. This report led many, including some American lawmakers, to question where the $5 billion in <a href=“http://www.worldpress.org/Asia/1434.cfm”>US aid</a> to Pakistan since 2001 has been going. To complicate matters, a growing number of people in Pakistan began to question Musharaf's rule. This left the Bush administration in a dilemma. Pakistan has a slew of radical Islamic groups bent on creating an Islamic state governed by Sharia law. Pakistan is also the only Islamic country that possesses nuclear weapons and there is always the danger of it falling into the wrong hands. In an effort to combat the widespread discontent with Musharaf, the Bush administration turned to the one person who was popular enough to challenge Musharaf's rule on power: Benazir Bhutto. Bhutto, then an exile spending time between Dubai and London, obliged and held secret talks with Musharaf on two occasions at her Dubai residence last summer. Both parties, under the watchful eye of the US, agreed to Bhutto's return. <p>

The current situation in Pakistan doesn't bode well for the US-led war on terror on many fronts. First, Musharaf has proved incapable or unwilling to hunt down suspected al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters in Waziristan. There is widespread belief in and outside of Pakistan that Musharaf is playing both sides in the war on terror. He plays himself to the US as one of a select few of leaders who have risked everything to fight terrorists. His army has been reluctant to enter Waziristan and it is believed his army has made certain concessions with the terrorists in those areas. Meanwhile, Musharaf continues to receive billions in aid while tightening his grip on power. This past July, Musharaf, in an act intended to signal his determination to fight terrorists, sent troops to the Lal Masjid (Red Mosque), a <a href= “http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/saudi/analyses/madrassas.html”> madrassa</a> (Islamic religious schools often seen by many in the West as a breeding ground for terrorists), in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital. The ensuing nearly week long standoff between the troops and students at the mosque drew a lot of international attention though the verdict is still out on whether a madrassa was the right place for Musharaf to fight his battle against terrorists. The sacking of the chief justice of Pakistan's Supreme Court led to more demonstrations last November and Musharaf suspended the country's constitution as he declared emergency rule. Again, Musharaf didn't acquiesce to international pressure to stop the emergency rule. After emergency rule ended, Musharaf announced that parliamentary elections will take place early in 2008. Then came December 27th, when Bhutto was assassinated on her way back from a political rally in Rawalpindi, Pakistan's military city. Bhutto's death has left President Bush, in his final year in office, to make tough choices about where the future of the war on terror will be waged. Musharaf once again stands unchallenged as there is no popular political figure with Bhutto's stature. <p>

Neither the Bush administration nor the next President can ignore Pakistan because it has become central to the success of the war on terror. It is home to a rejuvenated Taliban and al-Qaeda, countless madrassas and possesses nuclear weapons. When Musharaf gave up his title as <a href=“http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/472545.stm>head</a> of the Pakistani army, observers saw it as a sign of potential “acceptable” moves by Musharaf to stir Pakistan towards democracy. That idea couldn't have been more far-fetched. Musharaf may have given up his uniform (much to the delight of the Pakistanis), but there is little opposition to his power in Pakistan and as such, he will continue to rule the same way he did when he had his uniform. You cannot simply believe that a 46-year-old army veteran will change his tune just because he has given up a title. I feel world leaders have not put enough pressure on Musharaf because Pakistan has become such a staunch ally in the war on terror. In doing so, they have ignored the many abuses of Musharaf's regime, specifically his ire towards Pakistan's judicial system. In addition, Musharaf has failed to address a number of social issues that afflicts Pakistan such as human rights and widespread poverty. Musharaf and the US remain unpopular figures in Pakistan because many do not feel the US has done enough to solve the aforementioned problems nor has it pressured Musharaf to hold heavily contested presidential elections. It is simply too late for the US to stop its support of Musharaf, so a new alternative must be conjured up to counter Musharaf. In a country with a history of military coup d'etats, should radical militants seize power; the nature of our present relationship with Pakistan will take a drastic and ugly turn.
