          <p>
            My second Edit Jam... A whole new experience to share and to be proud of.

This event was different than the first one, because now I was part of EdLab. During my first Edit Jam I was just an anxious spectator trying to use unfamiliar tools.

But I finally made it. Having this opportunity to talk about something so serious as Hurricane Katrina, where a lot of pain and death was spread, was a new challenge for me. The fact that I was learning about something very serious and interesting that everybody cares about was a challenge for me.

I was amazed when I came in, this place looked very different than usual, and it was so crowded that I couldn't even see my friends.

Having to teach or explain to people I don't know wasn't much of a challenge because I'm very used to teaching and being a leader of a group or in my class.
I loved the fact that I was a part of this group of older and more experienced people than me. I learned more and I enjoyed the Edit Jam the most that way.

I hope you like my point of view about the Edit Jam.
