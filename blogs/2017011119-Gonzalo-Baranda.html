<p>Gonzalo Baranda is the co-founder of <a href="https://www.blinklearning.com/LMS/index.php?bd=main&skin=">Blinklearning</a>, a Madrid-based startup that aims to personalize learning by providing teachers with tools to create high-quality educational material. Previous to Blinklearning, Baranda was a vice president at JP Morgan, where he worked as a macro strategist. He also worked for Morgan Stanley and was a founding partner of Compas3, a web-based startup. He obtained a bachelor's degree from CUNEF in Madrid and an MBA from Columbia University.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and professional experience shape your work now at Blinklearning?</b><br>
<p>In 2000, I became involved in an internet startup that focused on providing free access to online courses. We received courses which we uploaded to the platform and offered to students worldwide for free. That experience made us realize the potential of technology for linking teachers to students and making knowledge accessible to millions of people. Blinklearning is just an evolution of that very same idea. We just put together high quality content providers with teachers and students providing a smooth delivery system for that content through any mobile device. My previous experiences have also helped me realize that it is true that a better education opens up new opportunities. I was very fortunate to have the chance to study at Columbia and personally experienced it firsthand.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at Blinklearning will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>We believe technology can help to improve education. Our aim is to make new tools available to teachers so that they can personalize education. We believe that teachers are the ones transforming education and our role is to put new ways to engage students at their disposal and be better prepared for the future ahead.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>I am more aware of the trends related to technology than in other fields. In most cases, these trends have to do with the fact that technology allows you to learn everywhere and the learning experience can be much more focused on individual needs. For instance, there is increased access to digital content through mobile devices. This has opened up a great future for different sorts of blended education. The increased usage of data is also helping to tailor content to address very specific needs or skills. Besides, technology is helping spread good practices among teachers very quickly and is making it much easier to apply new methodologies more suited to students.</p>

<p><b>Apart from your role at Blinklearning, what are you currently working on and what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>Blinklearning is keeping me fully busy. We are now working on a new tool called Blinkanalytics to provide teachers with interesting data on how students are learning and the challenges they may be facing. We would like to evolve the tool so that it can identify potential problems for students like hyperactivity and develop content to address these specific issues.</p>
