            EdLab Summer Interns participate in a range of team-based and lab-wide activities and events. All interns contribute to the EdLab blog and other publications, and all interns have the opportunity to work with EdLab teams as they present and participate in conferences and workshops related to EdLab projects.

<b>Examples of Past Projects</b>

Each year 10-15 interns from across the country and around the world join the EdLab teams. Examples of past interns and their work include:
<ul>

<li><a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/3648">Scott Khamphoune</a> worked with the software engineering team to build the desktop version of <a href="http://newlearningtimes.com">The New Learning Times</a>  (NLT).  He worked with engineers and designers on NLT's back-end design and implementation, improved the usability of NLT's content management system, and re-built and debugged a custom javascript video player.  Scott also conducted user testing and organized user feedback data.</li>

<li><a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/3745">Felix Chang</a> worked with the design team on data visualization. He developed an interactive PDF to highlight connections between Teachers College presidents and professors, and his efforts resulted in a 600 page eBook entitled, <a href="http://library.tc.columbia.edu/news.php?id=864">"Scholars at TC"</a> that was featured as part of TC's 125th year anniversary celebration.</li>

<li><a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/2759">Rebecca Chovnick</a> worked with the publishing team. Rebecca added historical photographs of Teachers College to the <a href="http://historicalphotos.pressible.org/">Historical Photograph</a> site on <a href="http://pressible.org">Pressible</a>. She made comparisons between today's Teachers College campus and pictures of the campus from the early 1900's. Another exciting project Rebecca participated in was figuring out the story behind two beautiful photographs from China. After receiving help translating the calligraphy written on the photographs she was able to determine that the photographs were gifts for Teachers College professor <a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/browse/120">Paul Monroe</a> from a prominent Chinese politician. Rebecca also helped create the Pressible site, <a href="http://archivalrevival.pressible.org/">Archival Revival</a>, a site that showcases slides, books and other artifacts that are a part of the Teachers College archive.</li>

<li><a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/742">Rebekah Judson</a> was a blogger for the <a href="http://www.teachingthelevees.org/?page_id=10">Teaching the Levees</a> project during Summer 2009. Read Rebekah's posts <a href="http://www.teachingthelevees.org/">here</a>. She was a sophomore at Swarthmore College, and a prospective special major in History and Education, with a minor in Russian.</li> 

<li><a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/792">Adrien Levinger</a> participated in several <a href="http://aftered.tv">After Ed</a> productions and created <a href="http://aftered.tv/afteredteam/skateboarding-and-education">Skateboarding and Education</a>. He was studying at an engineering school specializing in telecommunications in France.</li>
