            EdLab designed and developed an innovative digital archive driven by user participation. The <a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/">PocketKnowledge</a> project began in 2005 with the growing need for a digital repository to store historical works from the Teachers College community, ranging from faculty publications to student dissertations.

After considering a variety of prepackaged systems such as <a href="http://www.dspace.org/">DSpace</a>, EdLab moved to create the first university archive which grows bottom-up from the community that uses it. Using multiple graphical models, PocketKnowledge is designed to display topological information about various file designators such as Community, Tags, Authors and Uploader. Each of these designators may be viewed individually to display the files with which they are associated, or intersected to display only those files associated with <em>all</em> of the selected designators.

Born into the <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html">Web2.0</a> paradigm, PocketKnowledge allows all users to upload content, form communities and post comments related to the scholarly content of the archive. To protect ownership of the user's intellectual property, PocketKnowledge allows users to specify to whom their content is visible, be it the world, the university or only themselves. Communities have similar powers, by deciding to be public or private with a membership list.

In the fall of 2006, EdLab launched a marketing campaign to rollout PocketKnowlege to the Teachers College community. The campaign included campus events, training sessions, and advertising.

As part of the marketing effort, EdLab created short video commercials. The videos are a combination of video testimonials and clay animation. Every commercial features <i>Phil, The Pocket</i>, in clay form. The testimonials highlight features of PocketKnowledge which people from all walks of academic life - from prospective students to current scholars will find useful. The videos were launched using YouTube, and linked to via ads on the Teachers College library website.

EdLab will be collecting data on the rollout of PocketKnowledge to inform further marketing efforts.
