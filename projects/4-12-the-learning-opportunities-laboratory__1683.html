            This project will create a new course that will operate as a laboratory for the design and development of infrastructures to support learning and teaching. Drawing on literatures in the sociology of organizations, design-based thinking, and social learning, the course will engage students and faculty from multiple programs with an interest in developing new educational opportunities in organizational units and networked environments.  Each semester the course will be engaged in designing, piloting, and evaluating new applications, environments, and systems that facilitate the learning process.  

Design-based methods are emerging as important strategies for advancing social, economic, and political change.  In higher education, fields such as medicine, business, engineering, and architecture have embraced these approaches for the purposes of enhancing research, problem-solving, and teaching.  Design approaches to research in education have operated by developing, testing, and refining theories in real contexts.  These principles inform and guide the work of the EdLab.

The course will provide an opportunity for students to utilize their knowledge of research, policy, and practice in the design of organizations, environments, and infrastructures to support teaching and learning.  Those might include district networks for principals' professional development, online resources to support evidence-based practice, or tools to facilitate the analysis and use of accountability data.  Our hope is that students will generate useful knowledge and useful interventions through these design activities.

Spring Semester 2008 — Conduct background research on design-based pedagogy; hold design event with relevant TC faculty and others; develop prototype components 

Summer 2008 — Using a design-your-own course model, a small group of pioneer students will work together to create, pilot, and evaluate course  components 

Fall Semester 2008 — Continue pilot activities; Submit course proposal for FEC review

Spring Semester 2009 — Initial course offering

Students are welcome to join the course development team at any time and may enroll in HUDF5100 for 1 to 6 points of credit.
