            EdLab has taken a leading role in online publishing with staff involved in launching online publications, offering workshops on new approaches to publishing online, and conducting research to further understanding of the role and potential of online publications as part of the growing digital educational environment.

EdLab staff played key roles in developing the online version of the Teachers College Record, the century-old academic journal of Teachers College.  A weekly online publication was added to the journal's quarterly print offering, and the resulting increased exposure allowed the print version to expand to become a monthly offering.  The online journal has continued to advance with new features and services for readers and the introduction of low-cost online only subscriptions.  EdLab's related <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/422">Launching E-Journals Project</a> now offers other editorial teams the opportunity to publish online with minimal cost and effort.

EdLab staff are regularly involved in offering presentations and workshops on various aspects of online publishing.  These efforts have focused on topics relevant to academic publishing in general as well as those related to the particular issues entailed with electronic publishing.  EdLab has developed special expertise in monitoring the development of online publications and modifying online operations to maximize audience engagement.

EdLab has also been involved in research efforts connected with online publishing projects.  These efforts have involved both basic analyses of online user behavior and more fine-grained studies of the network behavior of online readers.  The lessons learned from studies of online publishing have informed efforts at EdLab to re-position educational research for the online world.
