            Empirical evidence has highlighted time and again the success of organizations, whether academic or corporate, that systematically support and nurture disruptive ideas and innovative products. But the launch and commercialization of such ideas have mostly relied on outdated (and relatively expensive) models, in which there is not much focus on demystifying and mapping the process by which viable venture ideas actually come about. Furthermore, emphasis has been typically put on encouraging entrepreneurs and innovators to linearly develop business plans first, secure financial resources, and then attempt a full build - this is understandable given how expensive and time-consuming prototyping have historically been. But the world has radically changed, with new tools yielding new possibilities for an agile, non-sequential approach.

In this interactive seminar, award-winning Professor R.A. Farrokhnia (Columbia Schools of Engineering and Business) will share research, insight, and practical guidelines on formulating and developing “ideas with potential” as well as on transforming them into prototypes through Lean Product Design Sprints in as fast as 5 days (complete with first-hand user-testing data). Such techniques take into account severe resource limitations that aspiring entrepreneurs face, and will highlight the power of such tactics to inventively circumvent and hack these impediments.

Prof. Farrokhnia will also showcase how some of the best practices in Design Thinking and Design Studio Methodologies are deployed at the likes of Google Design Studio, Google Creative Lab, MIT Media Lab, and IDEO (to name a few) for maximum product development velocity and productivity, whether for digital or physical products. Adaptability and customization of such models necessary for success in environments with more operational constraints (e.g. academia, governmental, and large enterprises) will be discussed as well.

Throughout the seminar and using some of the latest product design and development tools, the participants will engage in a number of collaborative mini-exercises, exploring the processes of ideation, rapid/iterative prototyping, and lean user testing and research.

EdLab Seminars are held in the EdLab on the Fifth Floor of the Gottesman Libraries in Russell Hall at Teachers College, Columbia University.  Open to all members of the university community.
