            <i>Evaluation Practice</i> is a conceptual framework for professional thinking and action (DePoy and Gilson, 2008). Utilizing social science research methods with the intent to solve a specific problem in the workplace, it bridges the gap between research and practical daily application. In order to solve a problem, this framework focuses on five main steps: problem identification, needs assessment, setting objectives and goals, taking action, and outcome assessment. This approach is adaptable to an individual's specific knowledge and experience, and is contextual to a specific problem and place. In this presentation, we will look at the overall framework of evaluation practice and illustrate how it can be applied to a real world problem.

Academic institutions often report to a variety of boards (boards of governors, trustees, advisory boards, boards of standards) and those that sit on these boards directly impact the institution in many ways. To that end, board governance is an important aspect of university life, yet efficiently engaging boards remains a challenge. We will follow the archetypal steps of evaluation practice to solve the problem of low board participation and preparedness. We will examine the implementation of Boardbooks, a board portal technology designed to improve communication between board members and administrators. We will also examine both the end user and the administrative features of Boardbooks and assess whether the problem has been solved.

<b>Presenter Bio</b>
Pete Jaccarino completed his MLIS at Wayne State University where evaluation was a tenant of librarianship and where he was first introduced to evaluation practice. In 2010 he was part of a small class at Wayne State who collectively wrote the manual for Koha 3.0, an open source integrated library system. He is currently the Manager of Administrative Operations in Development and Alumni Relations at The New School, where a considerable amount of time is spent working with experiencing administrative systems. He also has an MFA in poetry and enjoys breathing underwater.

Open to all members of the university community.
