            The transformation to digital media for learning changes the education experience - from the way learning materials are prepared and disseminated, to understanding how students learn, where students learn, and the ability to glean analytics and deeper insights about student performance. IBM Research has launched a number of new initiatives around educational transformation - deploying personalized learning pathways, cognitive computing (the Watson computer) to enhance learning, and developing analytics to enhance career pathways. We are eager to envision and shape the classroom or learning spaces of the future. 

In this seminar, we will outline some of the activities underway at IBM Research. We will then have an open discussion, about visions for the classroom of the future and possible collaborations between IBM Research and Teachers College.
