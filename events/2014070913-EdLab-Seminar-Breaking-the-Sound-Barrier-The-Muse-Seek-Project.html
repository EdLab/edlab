            This seminar will explore the mission and techniques of the Muse Seek project, formed in order to  break down the barriers between Music and Deaf communities. Started in 2013, the Muse Seek Project focuses on engaging deaf people with activities that until recently were considered to be enjoyed only by the non-deaf, such as music. Through research and innovation, the Muse Seek Project seeks to create a new platform to include the Deaf in music entertainment, crossing obstacles and breaking the sound barrier. 

<b>Maria Batlle</b> is the Founder and President of “The Muse Seek Project” - a Participatory Action Research Lab that fosters inclusion and breaks down barriers between the Deaf community and Music. Born in the Dominican Republic, Maria specializes in creative/strategic thinking, marketing and innovation through art. In August 2013, she attended the Arts and Passion Driven Learning workshop held by Harvard School of Education and Yo Yo Ma's Silk Road Project. Soon after, she embarked on a voluntary experiment in which she lived the life of a person that can not hear or speak for 2 months, in order to help her better understand the experience of a deaf person. The project was selected by the 2013 National Biennial of Visual Arts in the Dominican Republic. Maria was invited by Microsoft as a speaker at their symposium about Change & Innovation and was recently chosen as one of the Artists In Residence 2014 at the Marble House Project in Vermont, USA. In addition, Maria has founded <a href="www.iReadTheARTicle.com">The ARTicle</a>, a digital magazine about the lifestyle and culture of artists in the Dominican Republic and the world. 
 
<b>Hadi Eldebek</b>  is a musician, composer, cultural entrepreneur, and educator. Having trained in the study of Oud at both the Lebanese National Conservatory as well as under master Oud player Simon Shaheen in New York, he joined Yo-Yo Ma's Silk Road Project in 2009 as a Teaching Artist. He was a part of the development of Silk Road Connect, an approach to teaching that targets upper elementary and middle school students in low-resource communities where students are least likely to have access to the transformative power of the arts. Hadi is a board member of the Muse Seek Project, an initiative that focuses on the deaf communities by using music as a mean to engage the deaf in social life. Hadi is also currently developing instruMeet, a platform for musical collaboration and cultural education. He has recently led a workshop at the Arts and Passion-Driven Learning program at Harvard Graduate School of Education.

Open to all members of the university community.
