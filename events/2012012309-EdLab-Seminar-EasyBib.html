            <a href="http://www.easybib.com">EasyBib</a> is the world's most popular free online bibliographic creation and management tool. Over 33 million students used EasyBib last year to automatically and easily format citations for their papers. With our AutoCite feature for books, websites, and journals, as well as 58 other source types from which to choose, our users can always be sure that they'll find the correct way to credit their sources. Teachers love EasyBib as well because it encourages students to cite as they write, minimizing the chances of accidental plagiarism. 

Our institutional products, which hundreds of educators subscribe to, provide even more great tools designed to aid in the instruction of 21st Century education and promote information literacy skills. Some of these products include our notebook, which allows users to create, group, and tag note cards in a virtual space, as well as build an outline directly from those notes. There is also a website evaluation tool that encourages students to think critically about the credibility of the information they are citing online, as well as our own Research Engine that leverages sources cited previously on EasyBib in order to direct users to the best possible information.

There is a lot to see on EasyBib, from lesson plans to aid educators, to a writing center, citation guides, and topic guides to give students all the best advantages. We strive to consistently evaluate the needs of education and provide for them.
