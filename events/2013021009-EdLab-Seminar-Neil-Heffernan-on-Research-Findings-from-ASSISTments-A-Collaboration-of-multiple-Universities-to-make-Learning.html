            In this talk I will describe a shared scientific instrument being used by multiple universities to do cognitive science research on human learning in K-12 schools.  The web-based platform is called "ASSISTments" and is used by teachers and their students for 1) nightly homework support and 2) in-class formative assessment and differentiated instruction.  Our schools think of ASSISTments as a valuable free public service.  For this talk, I will address the different types of ways we use ASSISTments to measure knowledge, and the different randomized controlled experiments being conducted with ASSISTments.  I will give multiple examples of the different kinds of ways researchers can use this system.  Currently, we have 147 randomized controlled experimenters that conduct very short (minutes-long) experiments comparing different types of feedback.  I will discuss an NSF funded 8 year-long longitudinal tracking study we are doing in cooperation with Professor Ryan Baker at Teachers College.  Another example I will give will be a US Dept of Ed 10 million dollar math study where, in cooperation with Jim Pellegrino and Susan Goldman at UIC, we are exploring applying cognitive science principles to improve a commonly used middle school math textbook (Connected Math).  I will talk about data mining work done with ASSISTments data showing how data collected with the system yields more accurate predictions of student knowledge.  I will talk about the Efficacy Trail SRI is doing to see if ASSISTments can be used to raise Smarter Balance test scores.   I will also talk about joint work with Zach Pardos in which Zach won an award in the KDD Cup challenge in predicting student performance.   Zach's use of Bayes Nets to track knowledge helps us better track and report on student knowledge. Finally, I will talk about the online professional development work that Gates Foundation is funding us to do as part of our plan to scale-up to 1 million children and the PD work we are doing with the ~80 teachers a week asking for accounts.

Dr. Neil Heffernan graduated summa cum laude from Amherst College in History and Computer Science. Neil taught mathematics to eighth grade students in Baltimore City as part of Teach for America, a program that selectively recruits top candidates to teach in inner-city schools. Neil then decided to do something easier and get a PhD in building intelligent tutoring systems. Neil enrolled in Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Science Department to do multi-disciplinary research in cognitive science and computer science to create educational software that leads to higher student achievement. For his dissertation, Neil built the first intelligent tutoring system that incorporated a model of tutorial dialog. This system was shown to lead to higher student learning, by getting students to think more deeply about problems. It is based upon detailed studies of students, which produced basic cognitive science research results on the nature of human thinking and learning. Neil is now a tenured professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Neil and
his colleagues are working in close collaboration with teams of teachers and graduate students to create the next generation of web-based platforms to support teachers and students.  Neil's current research uses, and builds, ASSISTments, a platform used by 50,000 students as part of their normal class work. Over 50 million problems have been solved by students, and reported to teachers. He has received awards from the Worcester Public Schools system, and the Massachusetts Association of School Committees for his work helping schools. Neil has written over 60 strictly peer-reviewed publications. He has received multiple awards from his professional associations. Since coming to WPI, Neil has received over a dozen major grants (3 from NSF including the prestigious CAREER award, 3 from the US Dept of Education, as well as grants from the Office of Naval Research, the US Army, the Massachusetts Technology Transfer Center, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Spencer Foundation) worth over 13 million dollars. Recently, Neil's work was cited in the National Educational Technology Plan, and featured in the NY Times Magazine. Neil helped start the WPI Learning Sciences and Technologies PhD program and has seen it grow to include three more faculty members.

Open to all members of the university community.
