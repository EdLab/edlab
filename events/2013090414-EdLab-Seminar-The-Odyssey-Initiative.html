            Tired of hearing what is wrong with our education system? Come watch a multi-media presentation by <a href="http://www.odysseyinitiative.org/">The Odyssey Initiative</a>, three teachers' year-long journey to learn from the best schools in America before opening a progressive public school in Brooklyn, NY. A hearty Q&A and conversation will follow. 

Todd Sutler is the Executive Director of the The Odyssey Initiative. He worked as a teacher and youth mentor during his years at Amherst College. Afterwards, he traded bonds for an investment bank in New York, Toronto and Tokyo. Todd worked at Amherst College's nursery school, and after graduation, he mentored and tutored at I Have A Dream's Chelsea program. In the summer of 2004, Todd left banking to begin investigating opportunities in youth development. He visited schools, interviewed educators, volunteered for Harlem Children's Zone's Head Start program and helped raise funds for Washington D.C.'s SEED boarding charter school. In the fall of 2005, he joined The Boys Club of New York as Director of a social and academic enrichment program for teenage boys. In January of 2007, he began graduate study in Elementary Education at Bank Street College of Education; concurrently, he worked (and learned) as an apprentice teacher in first grade at Manhattan Country School and then in third grade at The School for Children, Bank Street's laboratory school. In 2008, Todd was a co-founding teacher of the third grade at Community Roots Charter School in Fort Green, Brooklyn. Two years later, he helped start their fifth grade.

Open to all members of the university community.
