            Technology advances have made the ability to collect large amounts of data easier than ever before resulting in massive datasets. These massive datasets provide both opportunities and challenges for many fields, and education is no different. Understanding how to deal with extreme amounts of student data is one of the major challenges in educational research today. Although this challenge presents many obstacles, the opportunities to harness big data to make major gains in educational efficiency is also attainable. One area that is especially attractive to the use of these data is adaptive educational systems. Systems, such as intelligent tutors, that automatically adapt to individual students have been shown to produce substantial gains in learning and efficiency, but developing adaptive educational content is expensive in both time and money. It requires the use of subject experts, cognitive scientists, and programmers, and the student models created often do not fit the data generated by students using the system. Data mining techniques can suggest improvements to these models which can improve the overall efficiency of student learning leading to a significant savings in time needed for students to learn skills. This research is enabled by DataShop, which is the world's largest open data repository of transactional educational data collected from online learning courses, intelligent tutors, educational games, and simulations. The data is fine-grained, with student actions recorded roughly every 10 seconds, and it is longitudinal, spanning semester or yearlong courses. As of December 2012, almost 400 datasets are stored including over 90 million student actions which equates to over 200,000 student hours of data. Most student actions are “coded” meaning they are not only graded as correct or incorrect, but are categorized in terms of the hypothesized competencies or knowledge components needed to perform that action. DataShop allows researchers to import data in order to use the provided analysis tools, and to export data from the repository to perform additional analysis. Researchers have analyzed these data to better understand student cognitive and affective states and the results have been used to redesign instruction and demonstrably improve student learning. 

John Stamper is a member of the research faculty at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. He is also the Technical Director of the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center DataShop. His primary areas of research include Educational Data Mining and Intelligent Tutoring Systems. As Technical Director, John oversees the DataShop, which is an open data repository and set of associated visualization and analysis tools for researchers in the learning sciences. John received his PhD in Information Technology from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, holds an MBA from the University of Cincinnati, and a BS in Systems Analysis from Miami University.  Prior to returning to academia, John spent over ten years in the software industry including working with several start-ups.  He is a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) and a Microsoft Certified Database Administrator (MCDBA). John was the co-chair of the 2010 KDD Cup Competition, titled “Educational Data Mining Challenge,” which centered on improving assessment of student learning via data mining. He has been the recipient of a number of awards including “Best Paper” at the 2012 Educational Data Mining conference titled “Automated Student Model Improvement.”

Open to all members of the university community.

If you are coming from outside the Edlab, please RSVP by February 4th by sending a message to Edlab at http://ednode.com/profiles/edlabtc/about (You must have/create an Ednode account).

EdLab Seminars take place on the 5th floor of Russell Hall at Teachers College Columbia University (525 W. 120th Street, NY, NY). For detailed directions within the College visit TC Route Finder: http://maps.tc-library.org
