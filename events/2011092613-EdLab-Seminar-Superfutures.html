            From Jennifer Openshaw, CEO of SuperFutures:

SuperFutures is the nation's first and only career planning community designed with Harvard experts to help teens answer: What do I want to when I grow up? And, How do I get there?  

Founded  by Wall Street columnist Jennifer Openshaw and endorsed by “Principal Figgins” from TV's Glee, SuperFutures leverages content, coaches and curriculum to help prepare students for the transition to college and to the working world. It features courses designed with Harvard experts that are delivered online as well as mini-courses from real-world industry experts — all designed to teach real-world skills not taught in traditional schools. SuperFutures, although a new venture, is now on Dell Computers and has been working with charter and other schools as well as parents.

SuperFutures has been called an “innovator” by educators and industry leaders. It is now moving to a new platform that combines the ability to complete a “Job Ready Certification Program” while networking with peers based on interests.  Its Advisory Board features professionals from Harvard, Google and Sony. Jennifer will be leading the Education 2.0 panel at the prestigious South by SouthWest (SXSW) Social Media Conference along with Columbia's Gary Natriello.
