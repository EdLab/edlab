            <a href="http://booktrack.com/">Booktrack</a> is the creator of the eponymous new technology that matches written text with music, sound effects, and ambient sound to create an immersive reading environment. The company's proprietary technology automatically recognizes an individual's reading speed and paces the soundtrack with the corresponding text. Booktrack is the first company to successfully marry sound and text to provide an automated, seamless reading experience. Booktracks have been created for the new novel The Power of Six as well as for classics including Sherlock Holmes, Peter Rabbit, Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and many others, and works by Salman Rushdie and others are on the way. At launch, the applications were available exclusively for iOS, but the company is actively developing for additional platforms including Android. The company is working with several of the biggest names in the music industry to produce Booktrack soundtracks including Sony/ATV Music Publishing and Park Road Post Production. The venture is funded by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, Facebook Director of Global Creative Solutions Mark D'Arcy, and The Hyperfactory CEO Derek Handley  


During our conversation, representatives from Booktrack will talk about our mission, including what drove us to found the company and focusing on the educational applications of our product. We will also demonstrate the application and talk about how it can be used as a way to get disinterested students engaged with reading, and we will discuss research showing how Booktrack can help with learning.
