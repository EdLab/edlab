            Come ready to learn, to think together, and to engage with passionate colleagues across a range of formats. Part of your time will be spent in interdisciplinary round table conversations that will tackle different topics of interest, from what climate change instruction is appropriate for our youngest learners, to how we fight back against climate miseducation and climate complacency in our communities, to how we make students aware of the ways that climate change will disproportionately affect people of color and people living in poverty, many of whom are from communities that are not major contributors to the problem.

            <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Come ready to learn, to think together, and to engage with passionate colleagues across a range of formats. Part of your time will be spent in interdisciplinary round table conversations that will tackle different topics of interest, from what climate change instruction is appropriate for our youngest learners, to how we fight back against climate miseducation and climate complacency in our communities, to how we make students aware of the ways that climate change will disproportionately affect people of color and people living in poverty, many of whom are from communities that are not major contributors to the problem. We’ll also engage in conversations around how we prepare our students to be citizens in a world filled with the downstream effects of climate change, including increased wars, natural disasters, and migration, alongside decreased resources. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Of course, we’ll also explore pedagogical approaches that can help your students think deeply about climate change. As a literacy organization, TCRWP will offer workshops on ways you can use literacy to help kids engage with this topic. You’ll hear about the critical reading strategies that help kids read scientific texts, as well as news articles and reports written about the topic. There’s a lack of writing about climate change, so you’ll hear how you can empower kids to write their own texts about global warming in a way that makes others care, and you’ll get an opportunity to begin producing your own writing. Science, technology, engineering, and math skills will be an essential part of the solution, so you’ll hear about key teaching methods (from some of you, we hope) you might harness within those disciplines. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">You’ll get crash courses from scientific experts designed to lift the level of your own climate literacy. And, you’ll have opportunities to network with other passionate educators, ones we hope will lead to future collaborations across schools, districts, states, even countries. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">We’ll suggest ways you can begin to engage students in this work, perhaps through week-long intensives that stretch across the school day and across subject areas or through units of study that help students to read, write, and think more deeply about climate change. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">We believe strongly that in the face of grim news, it’s not enough to wallow in your knowledge of what’s wrong. Instead, we need to empower kids to take real action, and we need to provide the teaching, time, and support necessary for them to do so. We’ll share stories of kid activists around the world that are making a difference when it comes to global warming, stories you could later share with your own students, and suggest ways you might rally your students to action. We’ll also examine the role technology can play in this work. We hope you’ll be ready to brainstorm with us, so we can learn from the best practices already in play in each of our schools.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Our goal is that you leave inspired, empowered, and ready to coach your students to fight for essential changes in the world. Our students and our planet cannot wait. </span></p>
