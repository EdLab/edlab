            <p>Over the course of the summer institute, teachers and high school students (selected through application) will work side by side as players to co-create an original theatrical production inspired by Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness. The overarching goal of this project is for teachers and students alike to reconceptualize what it means to read a difficult text together in the classroom. Specifically, players will experience: the conscious construction of a classroom community, the exploration of a text through multiple forms of art (visual art, sound, film, movement), and the power of remix (the process of “[taking] cultural artifacts and combin[ing] and manipulat[ing] them into new kinds of creative blends” (Lankshear &amp; Knobel, 2008)) in the study of literature.</p>
<p>The Literacy Unbound Summer Institute begins three weeks prior to the day the players meet for the first time. We send each of our twenty four players (high school students and teachers) a package in the mail--a copy of the summer’s text, a blank journal and a packet of ephemera with a note from “the author” of our shared text (composed, of course, by one of our facilitators) attached. The note advises players that they will start to receive an “Invitation to Create” via email each day moving forward; they are to respond to as many of these invitations as they wish in their journal, manipulating that given ephemera as they see fit. Each invitation relates to a particular part of the shared text, prompting the players to examine that piece of the text in some multimodal way. By the time players arrive at the summer institute, they have therefore both read the chosen text at least once and interacted with that text through their journals. Those journals become the first repository of potential performance ideas. </p>
<p>The initial week of the institute continues to build those ideas. Every day, the players engage in one or two workshops with guest teaching artists--a specialist in movement, a specialist in voice, a specialist in visual art (among others). These teaching artists guide players in exploring the text through their specific medium, and through these workshops, players generate possible pieces for their final performance. In addition, we set aside time each day for a “Remix Share”--an hour after lunch in which players share pieces they have created on their own out of the text (often digital remixes of some kind). </p>
<p>At the start of the second week, players look at all they have generated thus far--through their journals, through the Remix Share, through the teaching artist workshops--and they order those pieces to form a coherent performance. Players then rehearse and finally perform the piece they have devised for an invited audience. The goal always is to catalyze conversation around the shared text, so a talk back with the audience follows this performance. </p>
