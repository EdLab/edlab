            We wanted to help people read. Not the casual reading of a novel or magazine, but active reading–the reading that requires you to highlight and take notes, or to write in the margin and flip between pages. But remarkably, whether using paper or PCs, this active reading is hard–and the difficulty often stems from a rigidity inherent in the ways in which people interact with typical software and even paper. We developed a system called <A href="http://liquidtext.net/">LiquidText</a> to explore a different, more flexible approach to document interaction. The final system is a multitouch experiment in giving readers a rich, gestural vocabulary for visualizing, navigating, and annotating text.

To find out if this more flexible approach helped readers, we studied their behavior in a lab. People read and responded to documents using LiquidText as well as traditional media, and we compared the results. As I will explain in my talk, LiquidText significantly impacted the subjective experience and process of reading.
 
Craig Tashman is currently heading an early stage New York startup to develop and market products based upon his doctoral research. Craig earned his Ph.D. last year from Georgia Tech's School of Interactive Computing where he explored better ways to support deep, critical reading through flexible document representations. Craig's prior research included interactive visualizations for desktop window management, visualizations for usable security, three-dimensional image creation, and data compression. Craig also holds B.S. degrees in physics and computer science.

Open to all members of the university community.
