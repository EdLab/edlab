            <p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">This event aims to open a tradition of honoring the contribution and passion of Margaret Mead to the field of Anthropology and Education. In this first edition of the Margaret Mead Talk, we want to increase the visibility and honor the memory of this fantastic anthropologist and educator within our school, reinforcing her importance to the Anthropology Programs at TC. Graduate students of the programs, who are members of the Society for Anthropological Studies (SAS), seeks to provide to the TC community an opportunity of learning more about Dr. Mead’s anthropological work, importance, and legacy. The event will put together a panel compound by Dr. Lambros Comitas, professor of Anthropology and Education, who will talk about her immense contributions to American anthropology and the educational field. He will be joined by Marlee Tavlin, TC alumni and Co teacher at the American Museum of Natural History, who will tell us about Mead’s work and legacy in the museum. This activity will be open to all members of the TC community.</span></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.tc.columbia.edu/faculty/lc137/" target="_blank">Lambros Comitas</a> is Gardner Cowles Professor of Anthropology and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University.
