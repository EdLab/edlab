          <p>
            <a href="http://quill.org" target="_blank">Quill.org</a> is a free literacy platform that engages students with writing activities. Our mission is to empower students to tell their own stories. For example, in the web app Quill Writer, two students are paired together and collaboratively write a story from a shared list of words. In Quill Proofreader, students develop proofreading skills by reviewing and correcting passages that have grammatical errors placed within them. In the past two months we've had 20,000 students complete over 100,000 activities. 

Quill is being built on three principles: a unified platform, open source community, and active learning philosophy.

Unlike most educational platforms, our apps are tightly integrated into our platform. Typically, EdTech platforms are aggregators of content in which users are sent off to other sites, and the subsequent experience is not captured and sent back to the original platform. With our unified platform, we provide users with a seamless experience and receive data on student progress. We use this information to provide personalized learning recommendations to students.

Quill is an open source, nonprofit organization, and we're building an active community of educators and developers. We've already had 70 people contribute to Quill, and you can see a sample of these contributions at www.empirical.org/activity

We've driven by a philosophy of active, hands on education. For each app we build, we ask ourselves, “How does this experience enable students to express themselves?” We provide active, hands on learning opportunities, rather than passive, multiple-choice-based sessions. Students and teachers then filters out the best apps and activities by providing feedback on their experiences.
