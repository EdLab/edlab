            Seth Indigo Carnes, an artist based in NYC will talk about <a href="http://www.poetics.me" target = "blank">Poetics</a>, his visual poetry app that has been picked up organically in schools to teach a variety of subjects and curriculum, including special needs.

Poetics is now used in over 150 countries, across languages and age groups.  Recent work with the app includes a partnership with the NY Department of Education, with a STEAM workshop featuring Poetics and other arts-centered ed tech, along with presenting the app at NY Tech Meetup.

The EdLab presentation of Poetics will introduce and demo the app, including an outline of its arts-centered development through early physical artworks, and a brief review of connections between 20th century art and contemporary innovations in art and poetry.

The story of the app's adoption and growing usage in education will be shared, with an opportunity for discussion, feedback and suggestions moving forward.

The presentation will be open, conversational and frank, including an outline of the challenges funding and creating Poetics as an indie artwork, and fostering interdisciplinary support, crossover and integration of the arts in education and curriculum.  

Born in California and made in NYC, Seth is a media artist whose work explores the boundaries of contemporary culture: high/low, private/public, self/group, nature/machine. His work has been shown at P.S. 1 MOMA, Garis and Hahn (NY) White Box (NY), Emily Harvey Foundation (NY), and the Witzenhausen Gallery (NY).  In the past, he has collaborated with Paul Miller (DJ Spooky), Shepard Fairey and The Roots. Seth holds a BA in History from Pomona College and an MS in Integrated Digital Media from NYU Polytechnic.
