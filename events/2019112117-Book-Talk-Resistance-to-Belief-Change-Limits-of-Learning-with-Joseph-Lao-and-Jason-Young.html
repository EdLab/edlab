            On the various manifestations of resistance and learning experiences, self-directed and taught
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <p>Please join co-authors Joseph Lao and Jason Young in a discussion of their new book, <a href="https://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search/t?SEARCH=resistance+to+belief+change&submit=Submit" target="_blank"><em>Resistance to Belief Change: Limits of Learning</em></a> (Routledge, 2019).</p><p><br></p><p>This book examines the human proclivity to resist changing our beliefs. Drawing on psychological, neurological, and philosophical research, and integrating topics as wide ranging as emotion, cognition, social (and physical) context, and learning theory, Lao and Young explore why this resistance to change impedes our learning and progression. They also suggest that failure to adapt our beliefs to available and informed evidence can incur costs that may be seen in personal growth, politics, science, law, medicine, education, and business.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Resistance to Belief Change </em>explores the various manifestations of resistance, including overt, discursive, and especially inertial forms of resistance. As well as the influential factors that can impact upon them, the book also examines how the self-directed learner, as well as teachers, may structure the learning experience to overcome resistance and facilitate progressive and adaptive learning.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao and Young find that the impediments to learning and resistance to change are far more prevalent and costly than previously suggested in research, and so this book will be of interest to a range of people in cognitive development, social psychology, and clinical and educational psychology.</p><p>-- Publisher's <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Resistance-to-Belief-Change-Limits-of-Learning-1st-Edition/Lao-Young/p/book/9781138506336" target="_blank">description</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/psychology/people/faculty/developmental-psychology/joseph-lao" target="_blank">Joseph R.
