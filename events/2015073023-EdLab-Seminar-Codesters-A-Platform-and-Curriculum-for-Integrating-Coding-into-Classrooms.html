            A chorus of education and technology leaders has been spreading the word about WHY more kids should learn to code. It is an economic issue: a million computer programers are needed over the next decade to keep up with demand at tech companies that drive our economy. It's a social issue: there is huge shortage women of underrepresented minorities learning to code and going into technology fields that provide the highest paying and most rewarding jobs. And it's an education issue: coding teaches computational thinking, creative problem solving, and grit - critical skills that are sorely lacking in today's test-driven curriculum. The question is HOW?

At Codesters we believe that the only way to teach millions of kids to code is to empower existing teachers to teach coding in their classrooms. We also believe that the only way to reach the majority of students and to ensure equal participation from female and minority students is to integrate coding into core academic classes rather than relegating it to electives and after school clubs. Codesters is on a mission to get coding into schools.

Gordon Smith, the founder of Codesters, will demo our platform and curriculum developed through a series of intensive pilots at NYC schools over the past 2 years. The platform borrows the best ideas from block-learning environments such as Scratch, then implements them in a platform to teach kids Python - a major industry programing language. We use an online coding environment with a unique drag-to-text toolkit to lowers the barrier to entry for students just learning to code. Then we extend Python with graphics, animation, and interactivity to make it easy students to create engaging projects as they learn. Finally, we provide structured lessons that integrate coding into standards-based math lessons for statistics, probability, and geometry so coding can be part of the school day for all students.

Gordon Smith has spent 14 years teaching kids, training educators, and starting education ventures. He founded Codesters in 2014 after having founded and run Tutor Associates since 2001. Codesters won the NYU New Social Venture Competition in 2014 and is now being used by thousands of students at hundreds of schools. Gordon's original plan in life was to put a person on Mars, which led him to study engineering at UC Berkeley. He now sees enabling millions kids to learn to code as a reasonable backup plan.

Please bring a laptop if possible - this will be more interactive workshop than passive presentation. It is much more fun to create with code than to talk about it.
