            I wish to illustrate the beauty of small animal models such as snails and fish in the world of neuroscience. Using both neural recordings and in vivo confocal florescence imaging, I will show the behavior of neurons within the network of the brain and how it ties to overall behavior. Finally I hope to discuss how such models can be used to convey the beauty in the natural world, the exciting inner world of brain science and how we can tie it all to art.

Brief Bio:

Siddharth Ramakrishnan is a Neuroscientist currently working in the field of Bioelectronics at Columbia University in New York. He works on designing microchips to record from brain cells and using proteins to generate electricity. As a postdoctoral researcher at UCLA (2006-2009) he studied the development and physiology of reproductive neurons in the zebrafish brain. His PhD dissertation (UIC, 2005) addressed pattern generating networks in snails and how they were modulated to elicit various behaviors.

He co-teaches the Hybrid Worlds: Nano_biotech + Art course with Victoria Vesna and is interested in relating scientific concepts to the larger public. His collaborations with artists and architects have led to exhibitions and documentaries that blend the worlds of art and science. Currently he has been appointed Fellow of the UCLA Art|Science center. More information at www.siddharthramakrishnan.com

Open to all members of the university community.
