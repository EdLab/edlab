            When consultations at the TC Graduate Writing Center became a free service in the Spring of 2015, a surge of new users arrived at the Center with varying expectations and hopes for what could be done for them. But while we quote Stephen North (1984) in our mission "to produce better writers, not better writing," the perception of the Center as a "fix-it" or remedial service has grown. The view of writing as a product rather than a process persists, and we at the Center struggle with ways of not only pushing back on this expectation but adapting to the needs of the TC community (students and faculty alike). Our hope for this seminar is to share some of the steps we have already taken as well as discuss other possibilities with outside thinkers engaged in the future of education.

Ben Villarreal is the Coordinator of the Teachers College Graduate Writing Center as well as a doctoral student and adjunct instructor in the English Education program. He also teaches Freshman English for CUNY, where he is researching the use of video games as texts for his dissertation. He has been working in writing centers for the past 10 years, beginning as a masters student and then as  Assistant Coordinator of Academic Enrichment Programs at New Mexico Highlands University. This work has acquainted him with many aspects of student life in and out of the classroom, experience he uses to better understand student and faculty expectations.
