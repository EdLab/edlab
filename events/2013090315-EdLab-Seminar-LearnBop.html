            The debate about how education technology can support teachers and how often to use it has heated up in the past couple of years. Since LearnBop presented at EdLab over a year ago, the company has nailed down a very real problem that all middle school math teachers face - remediation. Students always forget concepts from previous lessons or previous grades. Attend this seminar to see how LearnBop's automated tutoring system is used by teachers to keep the entire class moving forward while providing differentiated instruction to help students catch up on a daily basis. Find out how LearnBop's teachers are using data to predict performance without fancy algorithms but with classroom results.

Presenter Bio:
Bharani is first time entrepreneur who grew up in Gainesville, FL. After getting a B.S. in Finance, he worked on Wall Street for 5 years and realized that money alone would not make a dent in education. Bharani left his career and got his MBA at Carnegie Mellon where he launched LearnBop with his co-founder. He now runs LearnBop with a team of 7 people and serves math teachers and students across the country to support the future STEM leaders of the country.
Open to all members of the university community.
