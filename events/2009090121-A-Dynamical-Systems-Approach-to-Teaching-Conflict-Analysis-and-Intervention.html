            PRESENTER: 
Peter T. Coleman, Ph.D.
Director
The International Center for Cooperation and Conflict Resolution
Teachers College, Columbia University
 
SESSION DESCRIPTION:
We live and work in an increasingly complex and dynamic world. Due in large part to physical, biological, and human cultural evolution, negotiators today are being confronted with progressively more complex ecological, political, economic, and social problems. In addition, the situations they face are in a constant state of flux; changing from moment-to-moment, and over the days, weeks and months of the negotiation process. The demands of working in such environments require that negotiators come to understand situations of conflict and work with them in equally complex and dynamic ways. Failing to do so can result in a misreading of situations and in the generation of short-term solutions to problems that prove unsustainable, or that bring about unintended negative consequences. In this session, I will present a new pedagogy for teaching negotiations in a complex world. It was first conceptualized as a methodology for working with stakeholders attempting to comprehend and address chronic patterns of destructive conflict and violence in New York City public schools. It has since been developed as a platform for teaching multi-stakeholder negotiations in various situations of protracted social conflict. The presentation will employ a newly developed computer simulation, The Attractor SoftwareÂ®, which can assist conflict-practitioners, policy-makers and conflict stakeholders in negotiating complex agreements without neglecting the dynamic properties and complexity of the systems in which they work. This methodology is one component of an ambitious research project on dynamical-systems and conflict, which is working to apply many of the important insights and tools from dynamical-systems theory to enhancing the understanding of difficult social conflicts.
