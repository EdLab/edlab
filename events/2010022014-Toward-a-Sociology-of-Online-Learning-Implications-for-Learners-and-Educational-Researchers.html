            This presentation by Gary Natriello is part of the Session on Unusual Spaces:  Exploring Unconventional Sites for the Study of Teaching and Learning.

The paper will be delivered at the AERA Annual Meeting in Denver at the Colorado Convention Center in Room 103.

Abstract:
This paper explores the social dimensions of youth learning in online environments. As youth around the globe have increasing access to the internet and the growing body of materials, applications, individuals, and social networks available through it, there is a need to understand more fully the contours of the learning opportunities to which they are exposed. Such opportunities are coming to constitute a more significant portion of youth socialization and learning and as such they represent significant new areas of study for educational researchers. Online opportunities for youth learning and development include: (1) access to materials in multiple media, (2) access to applications that provide interactive experiences, (3) access to individuals with diverse backgrounds, skills, and interests, and (4) access to communities and networks that embody social norms and values as well as expertise and orientations. Each of these types of networked resources varies in socially and educationally significant ways. For example, the materials available vary not only in media forms (e.g., text, audio, graphics, video), but also in level of sophistication, language, and cultural representation. The applications available differ in the degree to which they require creative, thoughtful input and the degree to which they are tailored to the performance levels of individual youth. The individuals who can be accessed online increasingly represent a broad range of human experience and talents. The communities and networks that can be accessed range from those that are deliberately structured to promote youth learning and development to those that are developed for purposes other than learning, both benign and pernicious. A sociological analysis of the forms of online interactions and experiences must consider questions such as the following: (1) Which youth — in terms of race, ethnicity, social class, cultural background — have access to which kinds of online resources?; (2) What are the forces — both online and off line — shaping such access patterns?; and (3) What are the social and educational outcomes of the evolving patterns of online access? Finally, the growing involvement of youth online poses a number of important questions for educational researchers. This paper concludes by considering five such questions: (1) In what ways, if any, do the opportunities for learning online represent different processes than those available off line?; (2) Along which dimensions, do the online learning opportunities differ from those available off line?; (3) Do online learning opportunities present different patterns of inclusion and exclusion that must be understood by educational researchers, particularly as they come to play a larger role in youth development?; (4) What new or additional research strategies are required to study online learning opportunities fully?; and (5) What are the implications for the growth of online learning opportunities for the preparation of educational researchers?
