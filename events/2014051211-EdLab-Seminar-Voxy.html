            The past thirty years has seen an explosion in empirical research on how to effectively teach languages; at the same time, technology has moved language courses online and led to a number of commercial applications for language learning.  Unfortunately, very few technology-mediated language learning programs are based on research-based pedagogic principles, and there is scant evidence that they work. After a brief overview of Voxy's theoretical underpinnings and pedagogical approach, this interactive presentation will demonstrate how <a href="https://voxy.com/">Voxy</a> has addressed some of the most persistent issues with online language training, from scalability to offering tailored, one-on-one live instruction.  Paul Gollash, Voxy's CEO and Founder, and Katie Nielson, PhD, Voxy's Chief Education Officer, will lead this interactive presentation.  

Paul Gollash is an experienced business leader, investor and entrepreneur with 16 years of experience building businesses around the world. He is currently the CEO of Voxy, a venture-funded education technology company based in NY that he founded in 2010.  Prior to starting Voxy, Paul helped start many businesses around the world; most recently he was a venture investor for Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group.  

Prior to leading Voxy's product development and efficacy initiatives, Katie ran large scale empirical studies on using technology for language learning at the University of Maryland Center for Advanced Study of Language.  Her PhD is in Second Language Acquisition, and she has spent her career teaching English and Spanish at all levels, conducting language acquisition research, and designing, developing, and evaluating language courses. 
Open to all members of the university community.
