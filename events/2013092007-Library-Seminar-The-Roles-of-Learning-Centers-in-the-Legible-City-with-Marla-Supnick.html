            Learning centers operate in fast moving environments that generate both challenges and possibilities. Several trends point to new possibilities for the dissemination of knowledge and ideas within intelligent liquid networks at an unprecedented rate. Trends such as big data, smart cities, cloud based collections, mobile library applications, digital way-finding, MOOCs, and social media offer learning centers and their users access to knowledge and information in an actionable form whose impact can be tracked. Unified Field will present our thinking on how to integrate new interactive platforms of technologies and media into the evolving smart cities to develop legible and learning cities. We will also explore, in a conversation with attendees, the role of learning centers in this new evolving network.
