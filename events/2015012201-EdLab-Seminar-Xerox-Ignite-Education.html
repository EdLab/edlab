            Xerox support of Education document management represents one of the largest global footprints in K12 schools around the world. The Xerox Innovation Group is a globally recognized R&D facility with centers in Palo Alto, Rochester, France and India.  IGNITE is the story of how these two histories came together to mobilize Xerox capability around the challenges of better learning.  Recently we have focused our research and innovation resources on understanding how we can help educators achieve their core mission and objectives.

We know based on collaboration with educators and the academic literature that more frequent “check-ins” and “formative” assessment are key to understanding how students are progressing in relationship to their learning objectives.  But, grading and analyzing student work is time consuming for already over taxed teachers.  Through a series of ethnographic studies and iterative prototypes spanning several years we collaborated with teachers and administrators on an efficient way to do these “check-in's” that fits into the natural flow of the classroom.  This insight led Xerox to developÂ Ignite, an automated student assessment tool that combines scanning hardware (to read and digitize student work created on paper) and analytics software. Ignite significantly decreases the amount of time a teacher needs to spend scoring student work and also extracts student performance measurements and creates real-time feedback for teachers. This gives the teachers the ability to quickly address the reality that students learn concepts at different paces and in different ways, and to customize their teaching, so individually or in small groups, students get the extra attention they need to achieve. 

In this talk we will demonstrate the Ignite product and discuss the challenges educators face in transitioning from paper to digital.  We'll explore the challenges education has in using data to improve learning outcomes and the ways companies, like Xerox can help education successfully deal with the “big data” problem.  Finally, we'll discuss how assessment/check-in data, combined with other data, like social/emotional, can be a stepping stone to creating Personal Learning Pathways.

Principal Scientist Eric Hamby leads Xerox's innovation efforts aimed at the education market. His areas of expertise include the use of data analytics to guide decision making, applying probabilistic methods in system analysis and design, and incorporating feedback to optimize system performance. Since joining the Xerox Research Center Webster in New York in 1998, he has also led research efforts and delivered technology in projects ranging from machine health management to data mining to xerographic process controls for Xerox's flagship printing presses. A certified Black Belt in Design for Lean Six Sigma, Hamby holds 59 U.S. patents, and 
has published more than 20 journal and refereed conference papers.  Throughout his career, Hamby has fostered university collaborations. He has served as a co-principal investigator on projects with Purdue University and the University of Michigan, which were supported by the National Science Foundation and the Xerox Foundation.  Hamby earned a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Kansas, a master's degree in aeronautics and astronautics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a doctorate in aerospace engineering from the University of Michigan.

This event is open to all members of the university community.

EdLab Seminars take place on the 5th floor of Russell Hall at Teachers College Columbia University (525 W. 120th Street, NY, NY).
