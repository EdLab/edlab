            <b>Presentation Outline</b>
Universities and colleges are using a complex array of software, services and technologies to deliver blended learning experiences. This presentation will demonstrate how UNSW delivered low-cost, high-impact learning & teaching environments that both harnessed and enhanced current technologies. Courses in Moodle & Coursera gaining increased assessment capability & visibility, personalization & social resource building opportunities, & understandable visualizations of complex learning analytics.

<b>Objectives</b>
<ul>
<li>Explain the desired learning & teaching objectives and related success criteria of the development program and the strategy employed in a manner that is clear, concise, and easily recognized as of shared interest and adaptable by other institutions.
<li>Demonstrate how the delivered solutions integrate with various core platforms (Moodle, Coursera and BlackBoard) and how they both harness and enhance the native capability of those platforms. Highlighting the ROI & benefit of this kind of development.
<li>Highlight that web development in the interstitial spaces between much larger platforms and tools is potentially the space where personalization and 'greater than the sum of their parts' experiences can be built or prototyped rapidly & too effect.
</ul>
