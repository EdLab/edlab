            <p>Please join us for a book talk with Dr. Barry Carpenter who will discuss his recently published work, <a href="https://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search/t?SEARCH=girls+and+autism&submit=Submit" target="_blank">Girls and Autism: Educational, Family, and Personal Perspectives</a> (Abingdon, New York: Routledge, 2019), co-edited by <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Francesca Happé and Jo Egerton.</span></p><p><br></p><p>"Often thought of as a predominantly ‘male’ disorder, autism has long gone unidentified, unnoticed and unsupported in girls – sometimes with devastating consequences for their social and mental well-being. As current research reveals a much more balanced male-to-female ratio in autism, this book provides crucial insight into autistic girls’ experiences, helping professionals to recognize, understand, support and teach them effectively.</p><p><br></p><p>Drawing on the latest research findings, chapters consider why girls have historically been overlooked by traditional diagnostic approaches, identifying behaviours that may be particular to girls, and exploring the ‘camouflaging’ that can make the diagnosis of autistic girls more difficult. Chapters emphasize both the challenges and advantages of autism and take a multidisciplinary approach to encompass contributions from autistic girls and women, their family members, teachers, psychologists and other professionals. The result is an invaluable source of first-hand insights, knowledge and strategies, which will enable those living or working with girls on the autism spectrum to provide more informed and effective support.</p><p><br></p><p>Giving voice to the experiences, concerns, needs and hopes of girls on the autism spectrum, this much-needed text will provide parents, teachers and other professionals with essential information to help them support and teach autistic girls more effectively."</p><p>-- Publisher's <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Girls-and-Autism-Educational-Family-and-Personal-Perspectives-1st-Edition/Carpenter-Happe-Egerton-Hollins/p/book/9780815377269" target="_blank">description</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://barrycarpentereducation.com/about/" target="_blank">Barry Carpenter</a> was recently appointed to the UK’s first Professorship in Mental Health in Education, at Oxford Brookes University. He is Honorary Professor at universities in Ireland, Germany and Australia. He also has been a Fellow of the University of Oxford. He was awarded an OBE and CBE by the Queen for services to children with special needs. In 2017 he was entered into “Who’s Who” in acknowledgement of his national and international contribution to the field of Special Education.</p><p><br></p><p>In a career spanning more than 30 years, Barry has held the leadership positions of Headteacher, Principal, Academic Director, Chief Executive, Inspector of Schools and Director of the Centre for Special Education at Westminster College, Oxford. In 2009, he was appointed by the Secretary of State for Education as Director of the Children with Complex Learning Difficulties and Disabilities Research Project.
