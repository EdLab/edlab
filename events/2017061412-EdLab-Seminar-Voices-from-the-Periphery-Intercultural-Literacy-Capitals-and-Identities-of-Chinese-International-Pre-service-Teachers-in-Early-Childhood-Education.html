            Professor Ting Yuan discusses her latest research presented at AERA.  
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <p>Topic: Chinese International Pre-service</p><p>Description: There has been a surge of international pre-service teachers who pursue early childhood education and stay as immigrant teachers in the United States. While teacher education has been dominated by White, English-monolingual perspectives, little is known about international teacher candidates’ experiences in their teacher education programs even as the field has begun to open teacher certification and employment to this particular group of candidates. Professor Yuan's study seeks to gain insights into the perspectives of a group of Chinese international pre-service teachers through a literacy methods course, as they exit an early childhood education program in the northeast. The findings contribute to the theory and practice for addressing the diversity and inclusivity of international candidates in teacher education curricula.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leaders: </p><p>Dr. Ting Yuan is an Assistant Professor of Early Childhood Education/Literacy at CUNY College of Staten Island. From a sociocultural perspective, Dr. Yuan’s research examines culturally responsive and multimodal curricular practices in urban school settings. Her work can be found in Childhood Education and English Journal. She can be reached at ting.yuan@csi.cuny.edu.</p>
<p>Dr. Elizabeth Morphis is an Assistant Professor of Childhood Literacy Education at SUNY Old Westbury on Long Island. She teaches both undergraduate and graduate literacy courses focused on teaching students in the elementary grades. Dr. Morphis’s research focuses on young children’s writing and how children connect their own knowledge to the writing work of the curriculum. She can be contacted at morphise@oldwestbury.edu.</p><p>Pre-Read/Media: None<br></p><p>Location: 5th Floor</p><p>RSVP by Friday, June 9th</p><p>Light Lunch: Pizza</p><p>Tech: None</p><p>Vialogues Commenters: TBD</p><p>Producers: Hui Soo Chae, George Nantwi</p><p>  </p>
