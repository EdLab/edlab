            If we wanted to develop educational media that supports "freedom", what would it look like? What do we mean when we use freedom in this context? Freedom, apparently, has some connection to software. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is "defending freedom in the digital world" while the Free Software Foundation (FSF) boasts, "since 1985 we've been fighting for essential freedoms for computer users."

Educational theory also makes its claims on freedom. This seminar will look at several recent theorists who have been concerned with the problem of education and freedom: Paulo Freire, Ivan Illich, Maxine Greene and Jacques RanciÃ¨re. Considering new digital media and social software, we wonder how these theorists might inform our design decisions.

In this session we will try to imagine what digitally augment freedom might look like, where it exists already, and if we can hope to design and code our way towards it.


Matt Curinga is a doctoral candidate in the Communication, Computing, and Technology program at Teachers College, Columbia University. His research interests include social software, social networks, wikis, blogs, mobile computing, peer-to-peer computing, peer-to-peer learning, and digital media and language learning. As an academic researcher he has participated in developing and testing case-based learning tools, multimodal writing software for bilingual learners, and StudyPlace, the wiki for the study of education. His dissertation research investigates the possibility of social software to support and enhance freedom.

Matt also has extensive experience as a software engineer, working on many large software projects for the web and for mobile devices. He was one of the original founders and first CTO of Crisp Wireless and more recently has been a lead software engineer and architect at the media research firm, Nielsen IAG.
