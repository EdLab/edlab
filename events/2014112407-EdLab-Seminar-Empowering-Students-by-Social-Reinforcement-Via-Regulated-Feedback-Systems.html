            Our first long lasting engagement with governance occurs in the school environment. How can we educate students to become engaged in improving governance? Outside the classroom students of all ages interact with a variety of services such as dining room services, library, playground, custodial services, and so on. In those environments, students are required to follow certain rules, but student satisfaction with institutional governance is rarely measured, and the students are not empowered to engage and drive improvements. I posit that this might have a long lasting effect on how citizens interact with governance structures later in life. To address this concern, I will present software tools we developed for designing communication systems between citizens and public sector monopolistic service providers, which can be used as educational tools in the school setting. The idea is to design virtual social environments that encourage participation and engagement with governance through social reinforcement learning. We call it a “regulated feedback system.”  

Dr. Ofer Tchernichovski will present data from a six-year experiment with regulated feedback systems at City College. He will then discuss the next challenge: How to test if regulated feedback systems for improving services in the school environment can have long lasting effect on phenomena such as learned helplessness and free ridership, which paradoxically drive people to become deeply frustrated and deeply passive with respect to governance. The purpose of this seminar is to discuss with you how to proceed with this (non-profit) initiative.
