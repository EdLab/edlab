            The primary mission of schools is to teach children how to use their minds -- how to think and learn -- so that as adults they will be able and disposed to acquire whatever new knowledge and skills they may need.  In psychological terms, this goal may be characterized as developing students' meta-level awareness and management of their intellectual processes. This seminar will focus on the metacognitive and thinking skills that underlie a key intellectual process, argument. 

Skilled arguers understand that their goal is not to undermine their opponent's position, but to undermine their opponent's argument. To become a skilled arguer, students must develop the capacity to understand the lines of argument that underlie their opponent's position, construct effective counterarguments, and anticipate and address rebuttals.  Preliminary research indicates that well-crafted educational activities can promote not only the development of argument skills, but also the meta-level understandings that ensure that the skills will persist once the instructional context is withdrawn.  As a result of this presentation, participants will learn strategies for helping to improve the quality of arguments and for inspiring students to expand the range of topics that they regard as worthy of argument.

Deanna Kuhn is professor of psychology and education at Teachers College Columbia University. She was previously a faculty member at Harvard Graduate School of Education. Her Ph.D. is from University of California, Berkeley, in developmental psychology. She has published widely in psychology and education, in journals ranging from Psychological Review to Harvard Educational Review. She has written four major books, The Development of Scientific Thinking Skills, The Skills of Argument, Education for Thinking (Harvard University Press, 2005) and, most recently, Argue with Me. She is editor of the journal Cognitive Development, previous editor of the journal Human Development, and co-editor of the last two editions of the “Cognition” volume of the Handbook of Child Psychology. In recent years, her work has focused on developing inquiry and argument curricula for middle school students. 

Open to all members of the university community.
