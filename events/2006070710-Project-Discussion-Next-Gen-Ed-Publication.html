            The EdLab Seminar presents:

Anna Beard will present market research on the potential of a blog-based publication for consumers of education. Anna's initial findings are a follow-up on a project proposal by Hui Soo Chae and Jeff Frank that calls for two blogs: 1) a blog that highlights the experiences of TC students as the make their way through their first year of student teaching, and 2) a blog that highlights the experiences of a handful of high school seniors as they navigate the process of preparing to go to college.

Please RSVP to this event (edlab@tc.columbia.edu). Lunch will be provided.

Notes from Anna on the event:

Hello Everyone.

In preparation for our discussion on high school journalism and blogging at the EdLab Seminar this Wednesday, it would be very helpful if you could take a brief look at the web pages listed at the bottom of this page.  While you are browsing, please consider the following questions:

1) What are some common themes present in high school newspapers?

2) Are there any features on the following websites that you admire?  Are there any features that could be enhanced?

3) What aspects of schooling do you think teens are particularly apt to speak about, critique and share with their peers and/or with educators?

4) If the EdLab were to embark on a new publication/web site primarily centered on the teen audience, what features would you like to see present?

Thanks.  I look forward to our discussion this Wednesday.

Sincerely,
Anna
