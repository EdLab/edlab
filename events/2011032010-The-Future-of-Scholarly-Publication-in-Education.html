            Gary Natriello will participate in a panel on The Future of Scholarly Publication in Education as part of the meeting of the Special Interest Group on the Communication of Research at the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association.  The session will take place at the Hotel Monteleone in the Bienville Room

Session Description

Join AERA Publications Director Todd Reitzel, and Teachers College Record
Editor Gary Natriello to discuss recent developments in publication in the
field of education.   The Communication of Research SIG has invited these
speakers to discuss scholarly publishing in general and in particular the
new AERA Paper Repository.  The Repository allows meeting registrants to
access all meeting papers and should lead to higher readership and greater
impact for many papers.  Todd can discuss the vision from the AERA side
and Gary, whose journal recently published a special issue on education
informatics, will provide a perfect complement to that very specific issue
as he discusses trends he sees in the publishing arena.

This is an informal session, bring questions, comments and alternative
views for a lively informative discussion.   During the Repository's
development phases, AERA explored repositories in a number of academic
fields, questioned the utility and status of the materials that would be
made available, and in general worked to assure that the needs of both
researchers and readers would be met by the new product.  While other
disciplines, especially in the sciences, have led the way to increase
access to research papers at more preliminary stages of development, this
is new in education.

Indeed new technologies are changing the landscape in many areas of the
field and Gary Natriello has taken the lead in experimenting with trends.
The October 2010 issue of TCR (Volume 112, Number 10) discusses access to
information as technology has confounded efforts at accountability,
access, security and individual rights.  Researchers want both readers and
ownership of their own ideas.  Publishers want to be able to provide the
branded access that has made education publications reliable for decades
while remaining relevant as new technologies change how everyone
generates, communicates and interacts with the research product.
