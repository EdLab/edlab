            Curious about the commonalities between microwave food and traditional eLearning?

Traditional approaches tempt us with tasty morsels of microwaved food. Other approaches lead us into a restaurant where the chef decides what we should eat, only briefly satisfying our hunger. How can we design a more collaborative and participatory environment that engages us in actively constructing a dinner together with others, rather than passively consuming it?

Based on this “cooking metaphor”, Frederik will share some thoughts and research about the problem of state of the art eLearning and the design of innovative learning environments using social media tools. After presenting social and technological changes and developments in educational settings, he will use a "learning by design" approach to present some prototypes of learning environments developed during a three-year research project. Applying a design-based research methodology, he will share a model for designing innovative learning environments with social media to actively engage learners and develop competencies for the 21 century.

Frederik Pferdt wants to take you on a journey on different projects of learning designs with social media, which he designed in research projects and university teaching. His basic research question throughout the last 4 years was and still is: How can we effectively design complex learning environments with social media? Hop on the bus and enjoy what he learned and discovered in different learning environment design projects. For FrederikÂ´s background and past journey visit: www.pferdt.de <http://www.pferdt.de> 

Hungry? Then join him for the EdLab seminar on Wednesday 04/15/09.
