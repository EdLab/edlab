            New York City is a hotbed for urban gardeners interested in localizing food production and revitalizing the genetic diversity of our edible ecosystem. For over 100 years the Program in Nutrition at Teachers College has contributed to research and action to suppot food choices that are smart for our bodies, our communities, and our environment. This summer, the EdLab has partnered with the Program in Nutrition to explore the role libraries might play in collecting, preserving, and disseminating heirloom seeds through its 5th floor container gardening project. Stop by Russell Hall on July 7th to speak with members of the Program in Nutrition and the EdLab about opportunities available to New Yorkers this growing season, and pick out a <b>free</b> edible plant seedling of your own to nurture into the harvest. While youâ€™re in the Library, stop by the 3rd floor Offit Gallery to view the exhibit <i>A Centennial Celebration of the Program in Nutrition at Teachers College. </i>
