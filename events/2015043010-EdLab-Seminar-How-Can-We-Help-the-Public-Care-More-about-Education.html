            Sarah Garland, executive editor of The Hechinger Report will talk about how journalists see the great debates in education, how we decide what makes a good story, and how we get those stories out to the biggest audience possible. 

More about The Hechinger Report:

Education is one of the most important issues of our time. Yet fewer reporters than ever cover national education issues. At the same time, politicians, education advocates and educators are sounding the alarm about unequal outcomes and stagnant performance in schools, along with issues of cost, quality and equity in higher education, and they're unleashing a flood of ideas for how to make improvements. More than ever, the public needs deep and incisive journalism that uncovers the real problems facing our education system and examines the evidence supporting proposed solutions.

The Hechinger Report is an independent, nonprofit newsroom that fills this gap.

Our goal is not only to replace or supplement what's been lost; it's to push education reporting to new levels of quality, clarity, depth and breadth, to explain why education policy matters and how it's affecting young people.

Our stories take readers into classrooms and onto campuses to show how students and teachers are affected by decisions made in city halls, state legislatures and Washington, D.C. We dig into data, statistics and research to discover inequities and test claims about potential fixes. And we go where others don't — to struggling schools in the Mississippi Delta, to booming university cities in China, to isolated villages in the Bering Sea, to community colleges in Appalachia, to inner-city schools in Detroit — to find stories that will have an impact on the future of American schooling.
