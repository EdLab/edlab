            David Thornburg will speak on "From the Campfire to the Holodek: How Place Matters in Education."  The seminar will be held in Russell 305 at 3 PM on Thursday, November 7th.

David is an award-winning futurist, author and consultant whose clients range across the public and private sector across the planet. His razor-sharp focus on the fast-paced world of modern computing and communication media, project-based learning, 21st century skills, and open source software has placed him in constant demand as a keynote speaker and workshop leader for schools, foundations, and governments.  His current work on new learning spaces resulted in the creationg of the Educational Holodeck â€” and immersive, interactive, learning environment suited for interdisciplinary exploration of academic topics through realistic simulations.

As a child of the October Sky, David was strongly influenced by the early work in space exploration, and was the beneficiary of changes in the US educational system that promoted and developed interest in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) skills.  He now is engaged in helping a new generation of students and their teachers infuse these skills through the mechanism of inquiry-driven project-based learning.

His educational philosophy is based on the idea that students learn best when they are constructors of their own knowledge. He also believes that students who are taught in ways that honor their learning styles and dominant intelligences retain the native engagement with learning with which they entered school. A central theme of his work is that we must prepare students for their future, not for our past.

In addition to his work with technology, David also consults on the relationship between classroom design and learning.  In this capacity he is Senior Consultant to the architecture firm, Fielding Nair, and is currently writing a new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/From-Campfire-Holodeck-Creating-Environments/dp/1118633938/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1382696131&sr=8-1&keywords=from+the+campfire+to+the+holodeck">From the Campfire to the Holodeck: Creating Engaging and Powerful 21st Century Learning Environments</a>. 

David splits his time between the United States and Brazil. His work in Brazil also is focused on education, and he has spoken at conferences and consulted for firms and educational institutions throughout that country.
