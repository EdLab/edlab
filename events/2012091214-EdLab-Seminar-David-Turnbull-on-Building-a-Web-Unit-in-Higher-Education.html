            David Turnbull is the Manager, UNSW Web and Innovation and Manager of the Central Web Unit at the University of New South Wales. He began his web career in 1995 and has accumulated a vast amount of experience delivering projects for employers and clients across web and mobile. Having spent 7 years in senior strategy and executive producer roles, he has previously built successful in-house digital production teams in a number of organizations, and has spent the last two years driving the growth of the Central Web Unit at UNSW. His core interests lie in user focused strategies and design, and the Agile project methodology.

Web units in higher education are under increasing amounts of financial pressure to deliver projects on tight deadlines, often with a lack of resources. In this seminar David will present a case study of how a successful web unit was built in two years on a cost recovery model in a way that has delivered high quality service to project stakeholders while saving the university hundreds of thousands of dollars a year on digital spend. This presentation will cover the approach taken in setting up the web unit, strategies to reduce costs and increase efficiency, a new way of looking at web as a service, a strategic overview of how the unit is financed and generates revenue and key insights from the last two years.

Open to all members of the university community.
