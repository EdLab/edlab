            Standardized mathematics testing is used heavily in schools to grade students, determine entry into schools and allocate resources. As the importance of the tests increase, parents invest in test preparation and tutors to give their children an advantage. For children to apply their knowledge effectively in examinations, they need to be calm, familiar with the testing process and unintimidated by the environment.

Adam Wootton from <a href="http://examelf.com/">Exam Elf</a> will outline the 12 skills that students can learn to perform their best in exams. Through many interviews with teachers and students, they have identified the elements that students find difficult and intimidating in an exam. By reviewing publicly available information, they have identified some of the key traps that catch out students in their exams.

The Exam Elf app is currently available for mathematics in Grades 4, 5 and 6 and is common core compliant. It has received very positive reviews from a wide range of sources (http://examelf.com/reviews.html). It is available as a free download in the Apple App Store.

Adam founded ZumFun - the company developing Exam Elf - to level the playing field between students sent for expensive coaching and those who cannot afford it. Adam has a Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Sydney and a Masters degree in finance from the University of London. Adam worked for Towers Watson, a large global consulting firm for 10 years in many countries around the world.

Open to all members of the university community.
