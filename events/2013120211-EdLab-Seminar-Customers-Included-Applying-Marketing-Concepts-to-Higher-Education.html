            Christopher Gu from New York University will join us for this seminar. This presentation views the major research university as a business, interacting with both external and internal customers as its primary constituents. It seeks to highlight the ways in which a higher education institution can operate at higher efficiency by adapting the mantra, "customers included." By applying traditional marketing concepts, this presentation will address the ways in which a university satisfies its external customers, its students. At a time when college tuition is at an all-time high, it is important for universities to re-think their value proposition and to re-assess whether they are adequately preparing their students with the skills and confidence to enter the workplace. It is important for them to approach this problem from the perspective of the students.

Additionally, this presentation will also address the internal customers of a higher education institution, namely the employees. Through a mix of organizational management theories and personal observations, best practices will be recommended in terms of motivating and engaging university employees, in order for these internal customers to better service the external customers.

Christopher Gu is an Adjunct Instructor at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies. He is currently teaching a graduate course in Financial Management to students in the M.S. in Human Resource Management and Development program. Christopher has also worked for several years in higher education administration and management, most recently serving as the Department Coordinator for the Marketing Department at the NYU Stern School of Business. He recently completed his M.B.A. at NYU Stern, where he focused his studies on Organizational Management, Marketing, and Corporate Finance. He also holds a B.A. in Journalism from the NYU College of Arts and Science.

Open to all members of the university community.
