It presents a wide range of research on adults who have low literacy skills. The various chapters look at the cognitive, affective, and motivational factors underlying adult literacy; adult literacy in different countries; and the educational approaches being taken to help improve adults’ literacy skills. The handbook focuses not only adults enrolled in adult literacy programs, but postsecondary students with low literacy skills, some of whom have reading disabilities. In this Book Talk, the panelists will speak about their chapters and answer questions from attendees. We look forward to your participation!</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.tc.columbia.edu/faculty/dp111/" target="_blank">Dolores Perin</a>, editor, is Professor of Psychology and Education, Chair of the Department of Health and Behavior Studies, and Senior Researcher at the Community College Research Center, Teachers College, Columbia University.
