In 1977, Dr, Mercado accepted a position as “curriculum specialist” in the new Bilingual Teacher Preparation Programs at Hunter College, and soon awarded a federal fellowship for doctoral studies in the new field of bilingual education. A Ph.D. in biliteracy and teaching experience, led to a full-time faculty position in the Department of Curriculum and Teaching, where she approached teaching and research as a collaborative project that promoted reflective practice and built on resources of local communities, shaped by experiences as a child, as a student and as an educator as she describes in, “Navigating Teacher Education in Complex and Uncertain Times: Connecting Communities of Practice in a Borderless World.”</p><p><br></p><p>This event is co-sponsored by the <a href="https://citeached.org/" target="_blank">Center for Innovation in Teacher Education and Development</a> (CITED) which is co-directed by Professors <a href="https://citeached.org/people/" target="_blank">Mariana Souto Manning</a> of Teachers College, Columbia University, and <a href="https://citeached.org/people/" target="_blank">Viv Ellis</a> of King's College London.</p><p><br></p><p>Please <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/navigating-teacher-education-in-complex-and-uncertain-tickets-72507825859" target="_blank">rsvp</a> by Monday, December 9th to assure a seat.</p><p><br></p><p>Where: 306 Russell</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://img.tc-library.org/w800/EdLab20191119210441_191209_booktalk_219x365_jpg344bda30-0b10-11ea-a9a0-29d5e56657fd.jpeg"></p><p><br></p><p>==</p><p>To request disability-related accommodations contact OASID at oasid@tc.edu, (212) 678-3689, or (646) 755-3144 video phone, as early as possible.</p>
