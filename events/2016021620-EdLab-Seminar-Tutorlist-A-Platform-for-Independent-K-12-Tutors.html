            Individual tutoring by experienced educators can take a good student to great or a struggling student to interested learner. But finding a great tutor - who is a great fit - is time consuming and difficult. Being a tutor means going through an agency that can take 50% or more of the fee, or relying on inconsistent word of mouth. Tutorlist’s mission is to help experienced educators to create an easily searchable, data-rich online presence, find and manage clients, and be part of a supportive community. Tutorlist’s founders, Waine Tam, Luis Pazmino, and Emily Johnson will lead you through their <a href="www.gotutorlist.com" target = "blank">platform</a> which launched in New York in December 2015 with 50 top NYC tutors.

Waine Tam spent nine years in finance before serving as COO of iMentor, a Gates-funded non-profit. He then switched careers and built mobile and web apps in education- and consumer-tech. He was a participant in NYC incubator Socratic Labs and was Developer-in-Residence at TechStars. He has a BS in Electrical Engineering from Princeton.

Emily Johnson led enterprise products at LearnVest, a fintech startup sold to Northwestern Mutual in 2015. Previously she was the third employee at AppNexus, an adtech company last valued at 1.2 billion. She has BA in Geology from Princeton.

Luis Pazmino founded the Autonomous Vehicle Club at CCNY, and led development of the university’s first autonomous vehicle using 10,000 lines of code in Assembly and C. He has designed and managed multi-national cloud-based travel applications. He has a BS in Electrical Engineering from CCNY.
