            Luis Nascimento, from the movie City of God and Director of the non-profit organization Cinema Nosso, will speak about his work with marginalized youth in Rio de Janeiro.

<b>Background on Luis Nascimento</b>
Since his appearance in the film City of God, Luis Nascimento has written and directed a number of award winning films revolving around social issues. He is also a founding member and President of Cinema Nosso, a non-profit organization that empowers marginalized youth through media and audio-visual education. Traveling nationally and internationally, Luis Nascimento speaks about youth media education, representation in TV and film, and Brazil-specific topics, such as the formation of favelas, and race/discrimination in Rio de Janeiro today. Luis recently established Nos do Cinema Productions as a means of generating work opportunities for the students of Cinema Nosso. Right to Mourn is the latest documentary produced by Nos do Cinema Productions, which focuses on the families of victims of police homicide in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. 


<b>Background on Cinema Nosso</b>
Cinema Nosso uses the tools of digital media to educate and empower young people through training in media skills, introduction to the job market and a means of self-expression. Cinema Nosso evolved out of the movie City of God . All of the youth in that movie come from the favelas (shantytowns) of Rio de Janeiro and were trained in acting and media skills for the Oscar-nominated film. It was such a great experience that, with the support of director Fernando Meirelles,  Luis and several other actors initiated Cinema Nosso to educate other youth from the peripheral areas of Rio. Participants in the program make movies, which have won awards at numerous international film festivals.
Cinema Nosso aims to become a center for a larger network of media-based initiatives in Brazil and Latin America:
