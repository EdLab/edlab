            mytuitiontutor (MyTT) was piloted in 2012 with an aim to provide qualitative
education in an affordable, flexible and convenient format to school
and university students in India. The platform provides an interactive
learning environment and equips private tutors, mostly volunteers and young working professionals, to utilize various communication modes to make learning enjoyable for students for under $2 an hour.

Even though the product sparked great interest in India, the market was found to be under-ready given the low speed of internet connection available in the country, leading to constant technical glitches. Therefore, it was decided to adapt the existing model, with slight modifications, in New York, with an aim to provide low-cost, qualitative, flexible and interactive education to the masses, while concurrently supporting the marginalized children in India by partnering with Tagore Foundation, an NGO in India that works towards empowerment of youth. A percentage of the students' sign up fees with MyTT will be utilized to provide education and work opportunities to the marginalized children in India.

<b>Bio</b>

After spending three years in the digital media space, Ashish founded 'Tagore Foundation' in 2009 to empower youth. Besides conducting training and skill development workshops for youth (16-25yrs), Ashish produced several educational documentary films and hosted interactive talk shows on contemporary issues on national television. At Columbia, in addition to pursuing a Master's of Public Administration degree, Ashish is working with Professor Gary Natriello to launch his social venture mytuitiontutor.com in the United States to make education accessible, affordable and fun!
