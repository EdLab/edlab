            In this interactive seminar we will take on an integrated perspective of the importance of arts in education and how the arts are critical for developing true learning in the classroom and beyond. Specifically for fostering meta-cognition and social-emotional learning. We will then experience the efficacy of story telling and group work through a workshop lead by the CEO of Ensemble Force, David Deblinger. 

Shafik Bahou is interested in the cognitive effects of arts in education and his work involves marrying the arts into education to empower the STEAM movement. He has dedicated his life to positive social change while using the arts as his medium and education as the bridge to a world that has life-learning continuity. In addition to a socially conscious reformed education system that inspirationally fosters creativity, passion, humility, diversity, camaraderie, and mastery. By freelancing as an actor, he effectively uses the theater as his laboratory to understand human nature in practicum, and marries his experiences to his formal degrees in Behavioral Neuroscience and Cognitive Sciences in Education from Teachers College.

For over thirty years David Deblinger has facilitated workshops, developing a unique and inspirational ensemble (team) building process. David began working as an actor in theater, television and film, and also started to facilitate ensemble building group workshops for an array of arts education organizations (Globalkids, Foreign Policy Association, Hospital Audiences, Soundance, British American Youth Theater Festival, The Floating Hospital, Community Works, NYC Department of Cultural Affairs, Dixon Place and more). 

These workshops engaged an array of groups old and young.  A highlight was guiding an ensemble of at-risk youth as they created a performance developed from their personal experiences.  This performance was presented at the United Nations for its “Rights of the Child Conference” in 1990. In 1992, David co-founded what is now the internationally renowned Labyrinth Theater Company.  David co-wrote Labyrinth's original mission and established an aesthetic emphasizing his ensemble concept.  He conceived two successful programs for Labyrinth based on this concept: The Ensemble Workshop and the Intensive Ensemble.

Through the years David has engaged groups of all different ages and backgrounds. His own skills as an actor and performance artist are essential in eliciting laughter and pathos, and in setting a tone and defining stakes for others to do the same.

Open to all members of the university community.
