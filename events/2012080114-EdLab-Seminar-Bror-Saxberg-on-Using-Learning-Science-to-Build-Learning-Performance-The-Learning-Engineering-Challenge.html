            With new technologies arriving by the month, and new possibilities for data analyses based on learners' characteristics, prior mastery, current progress, and interactions with learning environments (including teachers), we need better ways to conceptualize how to navigate the flood of technologies and data to systematically improve learning, and the learning experience, for everyone involved.  Learning science is also escalating - over the last 20-30 years, there have been rafts of carefully controlled studies about the cognitive science of expertise, memory, and learning that start to provide a framework for understanding what can work - and what cannot.  Putting all this together can be thought of as an engineering task:  building compelling, effective, affordable, reliable, available, data-rich solutions from what's known about how the world works.  We'll talk about recent efforts to start to do "learning engineering" at scale - and what is gained by this mindset.

Bror Saxberg is responsible for the research and development of innovative learning strategies, technologies and products across Kaplan's full range of educational services offerings. He also oversees future developments and adoptions of innovative learning technologies and maintains consistent academic standards for Kaplan's products and courses.

Saxberg most recently served as Senior Vice President and Chief Learning Officer at K12, Inc., where he was responsible for designing both online and off-line learning environments and developing new student products and services. Prior to joining K12, Inc., he was Vice President at Knowledge Universe, where he co-founded the testing and assessment division that became known as Knowledge Testing Enterprise (KTE). Saxberg began his career at McKinsey & Company, Inc. and later served as Vice President and General Manager for London-based DK Multimedia, part of DK Publishing, and education and reference publisher.

Saxberg holds a B.A. in Mathematics and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Washington. As a Rhodes Scholar, he received an M.A. in Mathematics from Oxford University. He also received a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from M.I.T. and an M.D. from Harvard Medical School.

Open to all members of the university community.
