            <a href="http://www.k12meets.com/">K12meets</a> is a product of ApprenNet LLC, an education technology company that brings online learning to life by providing educators the tools to build "Meets." 
<ul>
Meets are three step virtual exercises that give educators the ability to scale significant predictors of achievement: 
<li>observation of self and others</li>
<li>social capital between peers</li>
<li>mentorship</li>
</ul>
Meets can be used to teach any practical skills. Thus, Meets can be used to train and support teachers and they can be used in the classroom to teach students skills.    

Upon graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Emily Foote spent five years teaching in high-poverty schools as a TFA corps member and KIPP Public Charter School teacher. During those years, Emily attended night school and received her teaching certification in Early Childhood Education from Georgia State University and a masters of science in Secondary Education from the University of Pennsylvania.  Following her teaching career, Emily earned a law degree (with honors) from Drexel University and then practiced special education law.  As an attorney, Emily's primary focus was representing special needs students from high-poverty school districts.  Last year, with funding from a National Science Foundation grant, Emily co-founded ApprenNet LLC, with Karl Okamoto and Paul Tzen.  For the last year, the team focused specifically on legal education.  This year they plan to expand their focus to the K12 space. 

Open to all members of the university community.
