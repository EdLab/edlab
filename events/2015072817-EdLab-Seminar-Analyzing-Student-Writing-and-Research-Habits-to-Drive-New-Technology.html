            Over the years, Imagine Easy Solutions, the parent company of <a href="http://www.easybib.com/" target = "blank">EasyBib</a>, has released numerous white papers on how their users conduct research and practical ethical writing. With over 90 million student users across Imagine Easy's properties, we have the unique opportunity to delve deeper into how students find information, synthesize it, and use in class assignments.

Through independent research and partnerships with national research groups, we've identified major paint points that students face when working on writing assignments. Upon analyzing this data, our team has developed a brand new product, <a href="http://iescholar.com/" target = "blank">Imagine Easy Scholar</a>, to support students throughout the entire reading, research, and writing processes. 

This seminar will provide an overview of key findings on how students approach writing and research--stemming from our own research and third-party surveys conducted via Imagine Easy's websites. We will also provide an in-depth overview of Imagine Easy Scholar, including its interactive Chrome Extension and Google Docs Add-on, to demonstrate how Scholar supports students (and educators) in 21st century reading, writing, and research. We truly build our products based off of user habits, research, and teacher feedback.

Emily Gover is the Community Manager at Imagine Easy Solutions. She has worked with the company since 2012, joining the team as their first on-staff librarian. She has written curriculum, developed content, and now works with the thousands of educators around the world involved with Imagine Easy's community to better understand how tech can be used in instruction and learning.

Kathy Krupa has a passion for education and has worked with students and educators over the past 12 years. She works closely educators from across the globe supporting them with new and innovative ways to make a difference in the classroom.  

Imagine Easy Solutions, established in 2001, creates imaginative, easy-to-use services for teachers and students to promote 21st century writing, research and critical thinking skills, which are instrumental for success in school and career.
