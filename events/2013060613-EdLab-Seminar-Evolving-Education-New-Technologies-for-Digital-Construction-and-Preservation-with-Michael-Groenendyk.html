            Since the late 1980s there has been a strong interest in using technology to recreate and re-envision our world on computer screens. This is now changing, however, as more and more people are turning their imaginations back to the physical spaces around them. This trend can be seen through a number of rapidly evolving technologies such as 3D printing, 3D scanning, robotics, artificial intelligence, holograph projection, and the growing presence of these technologies in community spaces worldwide. What potential do these technologies have for educators though - and can they be used successfully by librarians and teachers?

In order to better answer these questions; in 2011 the Dalhousie University Libraries in Halifax, Nova Scotia, launched a pilot project to make 3D printing and 3D scanning technologies openly available to the entire campus. To compliment these services, an open-access, digital archive was created to collect various 3D models designed by Dalhousie students and also to store 3D scans of significant items contained in Dalhousie University?s many museums and art galleries.

This presentation will discuss the difficulties encountered in offering 3D printing and 3D scanning services to an entire university campus, the user base that emerged around these service, and the projects that users came up with. Other related technologies - such as holographic projection, robotics and 3D animations - and their potential applications for libraries and schools, will then be explored in further detail.

Micheal Groenendyk will lead this seminar. A recent graduate of Dalhousie University's Masters of Libraries and Information Studies (MLIS) program, Michael led the development of the 3D printing and 3D scanning services at the Dalhousie University Libraries. As part of his work he also set the groundwork for Dalhousie?s 3D model archive, 3D scanning various items from Dalhousie University?s on-campus museums and art galleries. He has a diverse educational background that blends computer science, business management and French literature/philosophy. Michael is a recent recipient of the Canadian Association of Research Libraries' Research in Librarianship Grant. His research has appeared in peer-reviewed journals such as Library Hi Tech, and he has given numerous presentations at educational technology focused conferences such as the Canadian Library Association's Access Conference in Montreal.

Open to all members of the university community.
