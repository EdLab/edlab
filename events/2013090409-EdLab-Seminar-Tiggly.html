            The <a href="http://tiggly.com/">Tiggly</a> team will explain Tiggly's mission in providing effective learning experiences for preschoolers by combining physical and digital play, and by actively involving parents in the learning process. We'll discuss about our learning philosophy, our first line of products, Tiggly Shapes, and our future plans. 

Azadeh Jamalian one of the co-founders and Chief Learning Officer at Tiggly. She is also currently a doctoral research fellow at Teachers College, Columbia University focusing on early childhood math education and effects of gesturing on learning and thinking. At Teachers College, she is the lead researcher and designer for MathemAntics Preschool activities under supervision of Prof. Ginsburg. She is also currently teaching Development of Mathematical Thinking. Her favorite childhood toys were the ones she and her brother designed themselves... Backgammon, Legos, and puzzles were (still are) also her favorites!

Phyl Georgiou launched Tiggly in May 2012 after it won a Harvard Business School start-up competition. Phyl has since taken Tiggly from a cool idea to a fully fledged business that is changing the way preschoolers interact with tablets. Every day he is overheard asking the same question "how hard can it be to re-invent the triangle?". Correct answer - hard! Before Tiggly, Phyl worked at McKinsey & Company and LeapFrog Investments. He has an MBA from Harvard Business School. Growing up in Australia, his favorite toys included Legos and puzzles. 

Bart Clareman is a co-founder of Tiggly where he serves as Chief Operating Officer. He received his MBA from Harvard Business School in 2013. Prior to HBS, Bart worked at Goldman Sachs in New York. He served as Editor-in-Chief of his business school, college, and high school newspapers, and ran a personal blog for 6 years. His favorite childhood toys were Legos, tinker toys, and a red Cozy Coupe that his adorable nephew now enjoys some 28 years later. 

Open to all members of the university community.
