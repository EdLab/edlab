            This presentation describes the impact on teaching and learning of using computer technology based on findings from neuroscience. We describe several big ideas in neuroscience and try to identify take-home messages that can be implemented in computers. For example, we discuss the finding that emotion is important in learning and that saliency and engagement are prerequisites to student learning. We describe an intelligent tutor that identifies students' emotion and provides appropriate emotional support. The tutor dynamically collects data streams of physiological activity and students' self-reports of emotions. Evidence indicates that fluctuating student emotions are related to larger, long-term affective variables such as self-concept, self-efficacy and mastery orientation. 

Neuroscience has also demonstrated that learning is associated with growing new neurons. This suggests that all students have the capacity to learn and change, especially if teaching is student-centered. Use of computational tutors provides evidence that by modifying the “context” of the tutoring (e.g., by changing problem difficulty and hints based on student needs) we may be able to optimize students' learning and attitudes. Animated pedagogical agents impact student motivation and achievement, producing increased confidence and reduced frustration. We also describe proposed research to develop individualized computer supported homework based on helping students to take responsibility for their learning outside of the classroom.

Beverly Park Woolf is a Research Professor in the Department of Computer Science at UMass-Amherst. She brings a multi-disciplinary background to her work with a Ed.D. in education and a Ph.D. in computer science. Her research team develops intelligent tutors that model students' affective and cognition and combine analysis of learning with artificial intelligence, network technology and multimedia. These systems recognize students' skills, model student knowledge and affect, and adjust problems to individual student needs. Some of these tutors enable students to pass state standard exams at rates 10-20% over students in control groups.  Dr. Woolf published the book Building Intelligent Interactive Tutors, co-published the book Transforming Learning with New Technologies, and has published over 200 articles. She has delivered keynote addresses, panels and tutorials in more than 20 foreign countries and is a fellow of the American Association of Artificial Intelligence.
