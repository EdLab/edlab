            Speaker: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kaiser-Fung/e/B0033ABLFM">Kaiser Fung</a>

When Nobel winner Daniel Kahneman was not busy creating the foundations of behavioral economics, he determined that statistical thinking is an unnatural activity; even experts sometimes fail at it. Yet, from stock charts to test scores, from theme parks to traffic jams, from credit cards to medical tests, statistics influence all aspects of our lives. Using examples from statistical practice, Mr. Fung will discuss some key statistical ideas–things they surprisingly don’t teach you in statistics classes. In addition, popular accounts of scientific innovations typically leave out the convoluted, imperfect process by which they enter everyday life. The adoption of statistical science provides a fertile backdrop for investigating this process. 
 
Bio:
Kaiser Fung is a statistician at Sirius XM Radio, with over a decade of experience in business statistics and analytics, in the media, Internet and financial services industries. He teaches practical statistics at New York University (adjunct). He has engineering and statistics degrees from Princeton and Cambridge Universities, and also holds an MBA from Harvard Business School. His book on statistical thinking, "Numbers Rule Your World: The Hidden Influence of Probabilities and Statistics on Everything You Do." <http://www.amazon.com/dp/0071626530?tag=numrulyouwor-20&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0071626530&adid=14M8PP5225NAB5EZS4ZX&> , was published by McGraw-Hill in February 2010.
