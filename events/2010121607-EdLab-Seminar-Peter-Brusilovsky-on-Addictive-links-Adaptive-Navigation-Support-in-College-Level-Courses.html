            Peter Brusilovsky from the University of Pittsburgh will join us to discuss his work on adaptive learning systems.

Empirical studies of adaptive annotation in the educational context have demonstrated that it can help students to acquire knowledge faster, improve learning outcomes, reduce navigational overhead, and encourage non-sequential navigation. Over the last 6 years we have explored a lesser known effect of adaptive annotation - its ability to significantly increase student motivation to work with non-mandatory educational content. In the presence of adaptive link annotation students tend to access several times more learning content; they stay with it longer, return to it more often and explore wider variety of learning resources. This talk will present an overview of our exploration of the "addictive links" effect in several course-long studies, which we run in several domains (C, SQL and Java programming) and for several types of learning content (quizzes, problems, interactive examples).

Peter Brusilovsky has been working in the area of adaptive systems and E-Learning for many years. Since 1993 he has participated in the development of several adaptive Web-based educational systems including ELM-ART, a winner of 1998 European Academic Software Award. He was involved in developing practical E-Learning courses and systems as a Director of Computer Managed Instruction at Carnegie Technology Education, one of the first E-Learning companies in the USA. Currently he continues his research on adaptive E-Learning as an Associate Professor of Information Science and Intelligent Systems at the University of Pittsburgh. Dr. Brusilovsky has published numerous research papers and several books adaptive systems and E-Learning. He is the Associate Editor-in-Chief of IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies and a board member of several other journals. He is also the current President of User Modeling Inc., a professional association of user modeling researchers.

Open to all members of the University community. Please let us know if you are coming from outside the EdLab so we order enough lunch.
