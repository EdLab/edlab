            This seminar will explore the role of arts in education and how they can be used to engage students across all subjects. The arts have historically been a common ground for connection and expression. Integration across academic disciplines can strengthen a child's learning. However, with the growing cuts to arts programming in public schools, a significant number of students are denied these valuable tools for connection, expression, and advancement. An understanding of how learning takes place in and through the arts, while considering the issues of access and quality, is key to approaching the challenges the arts face in education and how those challenges can be addressed. 

Hadi Eldebek is a musician, composer, entrepreneur, and educator. In 2009, he joined Yo-Yo Ma's Silk Road Project as a teaching artist. He was a part of the development of Silk Road Connect, an approach to teaching that targets upper elementary and middle school students in low-resourced communities, where students are least likely to have access to the transformative power of the arts. Hadi is currently working on his startup "instruMeet", a platform for music and arts collaboration and education. Hadi has a B.S. in Chemistry and Mathematics from City University of New York, and currently is pursuing his masters in Operations research and Industrial Engineering at Columbia University.
