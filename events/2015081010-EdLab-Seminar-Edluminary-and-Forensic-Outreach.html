            From the Science Museum Group to Holidaybreak, Edluminary and Forensic Outreach have worked with thousands of schools, student travel specialists, museums and multinational corporations in the attractions industry to redefine how people of all ages engage with science.

In this talk, Shivani Lamba, Founder of Edluminary, will reveal the imaginative approach that informs how its key educational initiatives — from workshops and summer programs to enterprise apps — were designed, developed and deployed, with take-home messages for a more immersive science classroom.

Shivani Lamba is the Founder and Managing Director of Edluminary, a start-up that specializes in the delivery of scientific public engagement, with Forensic Outreach as its most popular and celebrated educational initiative.

Edluminary and Forensic Outreach’s initiatives have been featured in: Forbes; The Next Web; EdSurge and the Guardian, which commissioned a special piece on innovative science learning for its Teacher’s Network. The team and its collaborators were also credited as consultants on NPR’s Serial.

Shivani holds a BSc in neuroscience (with a focus on developmental neurobiology) from University College London, where she was a recipient of the prestigious Open Scholarship. She is currently completing a foundation certificate in computer science (prior to an MSc) at Stanford University.
