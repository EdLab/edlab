            Our best teachers strive to individualize instruction for their students, and to do that, they need data that can help drive it.  While teachers are constantly assessing their students and collecting data on their understanding, they don't have a great way of leveraging the data they spent countless hours collecting.  Unfortunately, while technology could help teachers collect insights on students and supplement learning, most assessment software and adaptive learning programs today circumvent teachers and make them feel devalued as professionals. Assessments are for learning, yet we seldom practice what we preach.  

At this seminar, Jon Mordica will discuss why he created <a href="http://nutmegeducation.com/">Nutmeg Education</a>, a crowd-source-based assessment management platform, and how he hopes to save teachers countless hours and be better prepared to individualize instruction for their students. He will question our basic assumptions about assessments, standardized testing, and will help shed light on best practices in using data to drive instruction.  

Jon's passion for education grew during his time at Connecticut College.  After becoming deeply interested in how children learn, he chose to study Child Development and earned a teaching certificate in elementary education. As a result of his work with children, he was recognized for the Louis Lacey McGarry Award. To learn more about the great inequities in our education system, Jon pursued a master's degree in Urban Education Policy at Brown University. During his final months in the program, he found a significant disconnect between the goals of policy makers, the real effect those policies have had on schools and the services that various agencies are providing to support schools â€“ in particular, the way schools and educators are dealing with the pressures of high stakes testing.  Jon founded Nutmeg Education, LLC with the goal of helping teachers deal with these pressures in ways that can help student achievement, without using subversive teaching methods. By working closely with dozens of teachers, school leaders, students, and a team of sophisticated web developers, Jon hopes Nutmeg Education will do just that.

Open to all members of the university community.
