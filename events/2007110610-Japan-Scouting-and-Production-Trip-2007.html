            From November 15th to the 24th, Joachim Castellano, Skye MacLeod, and Tara Tarpey will travel to Japan for the purpose of presenting the TESOL 2.0 project, which was devised at EdLab, at the 2007 Japan Association for Language Teaching (JALT) Conference.  While in Japan, they will also represent EdLab and its mission in imagining the future of education.

The After Ed Channel will engage in its inaugural international production. Special Japan-related episodes for After Ed News, Level Up, and Out of the Box will be shot on location. Also scheduled is a visit the TC Tokyo Library where the team will introduce library services and programs available to the TC Tokyo students, including PocketKnowledge. In addition, the team plans on gauging interest in a TESOL 2.0/CSG technology workshop next summer.

JALT2007: The Japan Association for Language Teaching 33rd International Conference

November 22 â€” 25, 2007

Conference Theme: "Challenging Assumptions: Looking In, Looking Out"

JALT is celebrating its 33rd International Conference this year. This event gives us an optimal opportunity to take another look at where we started and where we are going in language practice and research...  Our Conference goal is to raise questions that challenge our understanding of how learning occurs, how we can plan our learning environment, and why we teach.

As participants in JALT2007, let us be prepared to ask these questions. Language research will continue to change and shift; this Conference will provide us with some directions for how to approach research and the application of its findings for the next generation of JALT.
